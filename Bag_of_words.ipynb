Action Adventure","30-Jun-22","The movie is ok. Many of this film's reviewers seem nuts","This film seems to spark a lot of people to say that this film is completely terrible or that it's completely fabulous because it included a gay relationship in the periphery of the main story, and to an even lesser extent, a convict character who is sympathetic. So. I'll address that quickly: None of that seemed like a big selling-point or issue with the movie to me. And those reviewer who make the movie all about those things seem to say more about themself in their review than the movie itself.\n\nOverall I found the movie better than what I was expecting based on it's IMDB score, but still far from being a Pixar classic.\n\nThe animation is very good, the story is solid even if it feels like a lot of the ideas have been done before in different ways and feels like a few ideas didn't quite work as well as possible. In some ways it reminded me of an inferior \"Up\". The main protagonist's circumstance were less sympathetic and more a result of his actual decisions. Overall I wonder how the movie would have looked if it had explored a B storyline for another character during some of the time-jumps. I also think the twist could have been established a little better than it was.\n\nThe voice acting for the film is fine. I didn't think a lot of the comedy landed well for me. But it wasn't awful like a lot of kids movies either and didn't detract much from the drama of the main story. Overall it will be acceptable to most audiences, with the robot cat being a likely favorite character for many viewers. Most kids will probably like it a bit more than adults and not notice or care much about the politically controversial content unless their guardians have already primed them to have an major opinion about it like them.\n\nI'd say it's a good time at the theater and better than the average score right now of 5.8. But don't expect it to be a classic Pixar film like Coco, Up, Walle, or Toy Story 1-3.",7,0,1,"The movie is ok. Many of this film's reviewers seem nuts This film seems to spark a lot of people to say that this film is completely terrible or that it's completely fabulous because it included a gay relationship in the periphery of the main story, and to an even lesser extent, a convict character who is sympathetic. So. I'll address that quickly: None of that seemed like a big selling-point or issue with the movie to me. And those reviewer who make the movie all about those things seem to say more about themself in their review than the movie itself.\n\nOverall I found the movie better than what I was expecting based on it's IMDB score, but still far from being a Pixar classic.\n\nThe animation is very good, the story is solid even if it feels like a lot of the ideas have been done before in different ways and feels like a few ideas didn't quite work as well as possible. In some ways it reminded me of an inferior \"Up\". The main protagonist's circumstance were less sympathetic and more a result of his actual decisions. Overall I wonder how the movie would have looked if it had explored a B storyline for another character during some of the time-jumps. I also think the twist could have been established a little better than it was.\n\nThe voice acting for the film is fine. I didn't think a lot of the comedy landed well for me. But it wasn't awful like a lot of kids movies either and didn't detract much from the drama of the main story. Overall it will be acceptable to most audiences, with the robot cat being a likely favorite character for many viewers. Most kids will probably like it a bit more than adults and not notice or care much about the politically controversial content unless their guardians have already primed them to have an major opinion about it like them.\n\nI'd say it's a good time at the theater and better than the average score right now of 5.8.

moments.\n\n7/10.",["isnt","bad","everyone","claim","dont","get","bad","review","score","time","write","pretty","horrible","dont","understand","isnt","best","disney","pixar","great","addition","clever","way","tell","new","story","set","toy","story","universe","bring","great","animation","array","emotion","come","love","studio","movie","lightyear","movie","get","andy","excite","new","buzz","lightyear","toy","universe","toy","story","great","scifi","action","flick","child","adult","story","friendship","acceptance","importance","take","step","back","time","time","chris","evans","buzz","great","job","capture","essence","iconic","voice","deliver","tim","allen","original","side","character","great","fun","dialogue","one","liners","especially","cat","sox","amaze","next","every","single","joke","make","theater","laugh","animation","story","great","feel","bit","safe","animation","stun","bit","bland","time","isnt","colorful","compare","movie","doesnt","distinct","style","stay","inside","boundary","story","good","quite","tear","pressers","something","see","movie","lightyear","feel","safe","exploratory","dare","previous","pixar","film","good","movie","worth","watch","especially","love","original","movie","around","fun","entertain","movie","great","humor","heart","wrench","moment"],["isnt","bad","everyon","claim","dont","get","bad","review","score","time","write","pretti","horribl","dont","understand","isnt","best","disney","pixar","great","addit","clever","way","tell","new","stori","set","toy","stori","univers","bring","great","anim","array","emot","come","love","studio","movi","lightyear","movi","got","andi","excit","new","buzz","lightyear","toy","univers","toy","stori","great","scifi","action","flick","children","adult","stori","friendship","accept","import","take","step","back","time","time","chris","evan","buzz","great","job","captur","essenc","icon","voic","deliv","tim","allen","origin","side","charact","great","fun","dialogu","one","liner","especi","cat","sox","amaz","next","everi","singl","joke","made","theater","laugh","anim","stori","great","feel","bit","safe","anim","stun","bit","bland","time","isnt","color","compar","movi","doesnt","distinct","style","stay","insid","boundari","stori","good","quit","tear","presser","someth","seen","movi","lightyear","feel","safe","exploratori","dare","previous","pixar","film","good","movi","worth","watch","especi","love","origin","movi","around","fun","entertain","movi","great","humor","heart","wrench","moment"],"Jun",["animation","action","adventure"],["anim","action","adventur"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11604,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,16,21,23,27,29,31,34,35,37,38,49,59,63,67,74,76,77,83,84,86,87,93,95,97,99,109,110,119,137,144,150,152,153,158,162,163,186,189,198,203,224,229,274,284,317,319,327,344,346,347,363,374,385,395,398,428,431,446,492,518,531,541,568,592,597,635,654,714,745,751,770,834,847,874,941,1076,1084,1089,1236,1287,1344,1436,1556,1707,1727,1793,1838,2028,2100,2383,2835,3312,4066,4098,6940,6944,11142],"values":[7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9578,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,11,15,17,22,25,28,29,30,34,37,40,44,53,63,66,67,70,74,75,76,77,80,82,88,90,92,103,104,113,114,117,135,144,151,159,166,168,169,185,193,210,215,216,227,233,244,248,263,300,312,340,353,359,374,384,392,412,414,419,420,435,485,486,500,523,529,553,555,568,588,653,661,687,711,731,742,748,756,771,797,821,857,883,910,1111,1162,1260,1333,1412,1512,1566,1641,1760,2005,2296,2496,2698,3073,3496,5960,9483],"values":[7.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[1,4,7],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[1,4,7],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},["Jun"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":12,"indices":[8],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11633,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,16,21,23,27,29,31,34,35,37,38,49,59,63,67,74,76,77,83,84,86,87,93,95,97,99,109,110,119,137,144,150,152,153,158,162,163,186,189,198,203,224,229,274,284,317,319,327,344,346,347,363,374,385,395,398,428,431,446,492,518,531,541,568,592,597,635,654,714,745,751,770,834,847,874,941,1076,1084,1089,1236,1287,1344,1436,1556,1707,1727,1793,

Action Adventure","16-Jun-22","What Walts Watching","In 1995, a boy named Andy got a new \"Buzz Lightyear\" toy as a gift licensed from his favourite movie that year.\n\n\"Lightyear\" is the movie about that movie.\n\nThis explains why Chris Evans can voice Buzz, because not all toy franchises use the original movie actors to voice the toys.\n\nThey sometimes hire voice actors (guys like me) who can mimic the lead actors voice for the product that ends up on toy store shelves.\n\nFun fact: Evans and Tim Allen, who voiced the character in the \"Toy Story\" franchise, share the same birth date, June 13th, just decades apart.\n\nThat said I loved this movie!\n\nIt's just pure joy and the animation is first class...wait for the sandwich eating scene.\n\n\"Lightyear\" is one of those rare animations that can make you laugh, cry and sigh.\n\nOthers that fall into this category are also from Pixar and Disney including \"Up\", \"Lion King\" and of course \"Toy Story\".\n\nThere are so many nods to other famous movies in the course of \"Lightyear\", including Star Wars.\n\nYou'll have fun just picking them out and discussing all of them with family and friends long after this movie has ended.\n\nBy the way do NOT leave till the house lights come on because there are 3 Easter Eggs in the titles.\n\nInterestingly even the name of the movie isn't revealed till the end of the film.\n\nThis animation would look great on IMAX...just saying.\n\n\"Lightyear is Pixar's first spinoff and second prequel after \"Monsters University\".\n\nThe LGBTQ community will be happy to see representation in a children's animation although it is causing issues in some Asian & Middle East countries with refusals to screen the movie.\n\nWhilst others see the relationship as too woke.\n\nLet's face it the creators are simply reflecting real world lifestyle's...same sex marriage is legal in most countries now...even Australia.\n\nListen out for veteran actor James Brolin voicing his first animated film role in his 80's.\n\nI can't tell you his character because that would a huge spoiler, but it will blow your mind and fits in with the \"Toy Story\" Universe.\n\nBy the way the on board navigation system \"IVAN\" (navi spelt backwards), Kiwi actor/director Taika Waititi playing a wannabe Space Ranger and a character called \"Sox\" are all scene stealers.\n\nI liked this movie so much I know I'll watch it again on Disney Plus but it won't be the same as my cinema experience which was so close to perfect.\n\nSee this with your whole family because it works on so many levels as great movies should.\n\nTo infinity and beyond!",7,1,1,"What Walts Watching In 1995, a boy named Andy got a new \"Buzz Lightyear\" toy as a gift licensed from his favourite movie that year.\n\n\"Lightyear\" is the movie about that movie.\n\nThis explains why Chris Evans can voice Buzz, because not all toy franchises use the original movie actors to voice the toys.\n\nThey sometimes hire voice actors (guys like me) who can mimic the lead actors voice for the product that ends up on toy store shelves.\n\nFun fact: Evans and Tim Allen, who voiced the character in the \"Toy Story\" franchise, share the same birth date, June 13th, just decades apart.\n\nThat said I loved this movie!\n\nIt's just pure joy and the animation is first class...wait for the sandwich eating scene.\n\n\"Lightyear\" is one of those rare animations that can make you laugh, cry and sigh.\n\nOthers that fall into this category are also from Pixar and Disney including \"Up\", \"Lion King\" and of course \"Toy Story\".\n\nThere are so many nods to other famous movies in the course of \"Lightyear\", including Star Wars.\n\nYou'll have fun just picking them out and discussing all of them with family and friends long after this movie has ended.\n\nBy the way do NOT leave till the house lights come on because there are 3 Easter Eggs in the titles.\n\nInterestingly even the name of the movie isn't revealed till the end of the film.\n\nThis animation would look great on IMAX...just saying.\n\n\"Lightyear is Pixar's first spinoff and second prequel after \"Monsters University\".\n\nThe LGBTQ community will be happy to see representation in a children's animation although it is causing issues in some Asian & Middle East countries with refusals to screen the movie.\n\nWhilst others see the relationship as too woke.\n\nLet's face it the creators are simply reflecting real world lifestyle's...same sex marriage is legal in most countries now...even Australia.\n\nListen out for veteran actor James Brolin voicing his first animated film role in his 80's.\n\nI can't tell you his character because that would a huge spoiler, but it will blow your mind and fits in with the \"Toy Story\" Universe.\n\nBy the way the on board navigation system \"IVAN\" (navi spelt backwards), Kiwi actor/director Taika Waititi playing a wannabe Space Ranger and a character called \"Sox\" are all scene stealers.\n\nI liked this movie so much I know I'll watch it again on Disney Plus but it won't be the same as my cinema experience which was so close to perfect.\n\nSee this with your whole

Action Adventure","16-Jun-22","A fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements","\"Lightyear\" is the 26th CGI animated film by Disney Pixar and a spin-off of the \"Toy Story\" series. Featuring the voices of Chris Evans, Keke Palmer, and Taika Waititi, it is a fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements.\n\nSomewhere in outer space, test pilot Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Chris Evans) accidentally causes the crew of his exploration team to be stranded on a hostile planet. With the Earth millions of light-years away, Buzz urgently tries to find a method of transportation to allow him and his crew a safe passage home, though repeated setbacks cause his research to take several years. As time passes by, Buzz soon finds himself joined by a robot companion cat named Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn) and a group of enthusiastic recruits who attempt to aid him in this massive undertaking. To make matters more difficult, a large army of dangerous robots suddenly appear to steal an important fuel source from Buzz and his new friends in order to appease their imposing commander Zurg (voiced by James Brolin).\n\nThe original \"Toy Story\" holds the distinction of being the very first movie I remember seeing at the cinema all the way back in 1995. As a result, I've always had a soft spot for this series and all of its characters. Like most children at the time, I was captivated by the toys of Woody the cowboy doll and Buzz Lightyear the astronaut action figure, the latter of which caused me to ask my parents to buy me one immediately after my initial viewing of the film (they didn't, but I ended up getting one for my birthday later on). There was always something so fascinating to me about Buzz Lightyear's origins, not necessarily as a toy but as an in-universe character, and now in \"Lightyear\", Pixar has finally provided a proper origin story to one of their most recognisable heroes in a film entertains as both an enjoyable sci-fi adventure and a solid spin-off to the original set of movies.\n\nIt is established right away that this film exists within the \"Toy Story\" universe as the favourite movie of Andy, the kid owner of both Buzz and Woody, making it something of a \"movie-within-a-movie\". Because of this, there are no references to anybody being a sentient toy or the canon of the preceding four films. Instead, this is a relatively straightforward story about the origin of Buzz Lightyear as a rookie explorer who hasn't yet attained the rank of Space Ranger. I like this approach because it allows the audience to discard any concern that it could change too much of what has already been established and simply enjoy it for what it is. With that said, there are some cleverly veiled allusions to the four movies scattered throughout in the form of quotes and visual cues. I'm not going to say what they were at the risk of revealing spoilers but I'm sure keen-eyed and keen-eared fans should notice them right away.\n\nWhile this may not be the first Pixar film to feature outer space as its main setting (see \"WALL-E\"), it still manages to use it as a great location for our main character to show off some intriguing personality traits not seen before in the \"Toy Story\" movies. We see that Buzz needs to create an efficient fuel source capable of transporting his entire crew of 1000+ people back to Earth several light-years away but ends up wasting many years doing so. This allows for an insight into Buzz's one-track mind as it shows that the longer he focuses on his goal, the longer he doesn't realise that everyone around him is growing older while he stays the same age due to the physics of light speed. Buzz is unable to form real emotional bonds with anyone tangible because by the time he returns to base, everyone has either moved on or has forgotten all about him. It's so interesting to see the way this film (and one aimed at children no less) treats the idea of light speed travel as a serious concept and not merely a plot gimmick. I'm not sure how accurate all of the science is in any of this but it all seems pretty well researched for the most part, at least as far as science fiction media goes.\n\nIn stark contrast to the earlier \"Toy Story\" films, which look a bit dated nowadays in terms of presentation, \"Lightyear\" is a beautifully rendered visual treat. I loved the attention-to-detail placed on the character designs, especially on their uniforms. For example, Buzz's space helmet flawlessly reflects some of the gorgeous colours of the cosmos when he's travelling at light speed and the cross-stitching on his shirt looks so realistic. In addition to this, the use of lurid lighting to emphasise the unfavourable conditions of the planet show how inhospitable it truly is, with Buzz and his crew making the most of what they have if they wish to survive. It's a true showcase of how far Pixar have come over the past 27 years, going from a small independent studio making short films to one of Disney's biggest animation juggernauts.\n\nI'll admit I was initially apprehensive at the idea of someone else besides Tim Allen voicing Buzz Lightyear but I think Chris Evans did a great job here. Though at first it sounded weird to hear Buzz with a different voice, I did get used to Evans pretty quickly and in some ways I almost prefer him to Allen. This is because I realised that Tim Allen voiced Buzz with a more light-hearted, comedic tone in the \"Toy Story\" films since he is actually a toy there and not a real person. In this film, Chris Evans voices Buzz with a more serious demeanour, like he's a heroic figure that people need to look up to and respect. That's not to say Evans's Buzz didn't have his own fair share of comical moments, as there were a few scenes of him where he ends up becoming the butt of some jokes due to some of his inexperience. Much like his take on Captain America, Chris Evans strikes a decent balance between sincerity and humour.\n\nThe rest of the supporting cast all had their moments as well, with Peter Sohn as the robot cat Sox perhaps being my favourite. Sox is basically a parody of all those odd robotic sidekick characters a sci-fi film protagonist may have at their dispersal. He is efficient, helpful, and is often used to solve a problem that the others are unable to do so on their own. At the same time though, I couldn't help but shake the thought that he was only added to the film as a merchandising opportunity. With that in mind, I foresee him being a popular toy for kids around Christmas time, maybe even bundled with a Buzz Lightyear action figure as well.\n\nKeke Palmer, Dale Soules, and Taika Waititi also voice Buzz's recruits Izzy, Darby, and Mo, respectively. The three of them are loyal allies for Buzz and it was fun to see how their newer way of doing things often clashed with Buzz's older point of view, leading to some disagreements within the group. Even if some of their scenes fell a bit flat at times, they were all likeable enough for me to care about them whenever they happened to be placed in dangerous situations. If I had to choose a favourite out of the three of them, I'd say Waititi's character Mo was the one I liked most, mainly because he's good at playing those types of clumsy but loveable supporting characters. Either that or his Kiwi accent is just very amusing to me.\n\nTaken completely on its own, \"Lightyear\" is another fine Pixar animated feature that's sure to entertain longtime fans of the legendary studio's work. As a spin-off to the beloved \"Toy Story\" series, it also functions as a nice little quasi-prequel to the first film. Though you might not learn as much about Buzz Lightyear's character as you may have hoped, you can at least see why he's such an appealing hero in the first place. Still, if you've ever liked Buzz Lightyear as a kid or if you happen to have kids who like him, you're bound to find at least one thing to appreciate about this movie, whether it's the visual style, the voice acting, or the science fiction elements themselves.\n\nI rate it 8/10.",8,1,1,"A fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements \"Lightyear\" is the 26th CGI animated film by Disney Pixar and a spin-off of the \"Toy Story\" series. Featuring the voices of Chris Evans, Keke Palmer, and Taika Waititi, it is a fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements.\n\nSomewhere in outer space, test pilot Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Chris Evans) accidentally causes the crew of his exploration team to be stranded on a hostile planet. With the Earth millions of light-years away, Buzz urgently tries to find a method of transportation to allow him and his crew a safe passage home, though repeated setbacks cause his research to take several years. As time passes by, Buzz soon finds himself joined by a robot companion cat named Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn) and a group of enthusiastic recruits who attempt to aid him in this massive undertaking. To make matters more difficult, a large army of dangerous robots suddenly appear to steal an important fuel source from Buzz and his new friends in order to appease their imposing commander Zurg (voiced by James Brolin).\n\nThe original \"Toy Story\" holds the distinction of being the very first movie I remember seeing at the cinema all the way back in 1995. As a result, I've always had a soft spot for this series and all of its characters. Like most children at the time, I was captivated by the toys of Woody the cowboy doll and Buzz Lightyear the astronaut action figure, the latter of which caused me to ask my parents to buy me one immediately after my initial viewing of the film (they didn't, but I ended up getting one for my birthday later on). There was always something so fascinating to me about Buzz Lightyear's origins, not necessarily as a toy but as an in-universe character, and now in \"Lightyear\", Pixar has finally provided a proper origin story to one of their most recognisable heroes in a film entertains as both an enjoyable sci-fi adventure and a solid spin-off to the original set of movies.\n\nIt is established right away that this film exists within the \"Toy Story\" universe as the favourite movie of Andy, the kid owner of both Buzz and Woody, making it something of a \"movie-within-a-movie\". Because of this, there are no references to anybody being a sentient toy or the canon of the preceding four films. Instead, this is a relatively straightforward story about the origin of Buzz Lightyear as a rookie explorer who hasn't yet attained the rank of Space Ranger. I like this approach because it allows the audience to discard any concern that it could change too much of what has already been established and simply enjoy it for what it is. With that said, there are some cleverly veiled allusions to the four movies scattered throughout in the form of quotes and visual cues. I'm not going to say what they were at the risk of revealing spoilers but I'm sure keen-eyed and keen-eared fans should notice them right away.\n\nWhile this may not be the first Pixar film to feature outer space as its main setting (see \"WALL-E\"), it still manages to use it as a great location for our main character to show off some intriguing personality traits not seen before in the \"Toy Story\" movies. We see that Buzz needs to create an efficient fuel source capable of transporting his entire crew of 1000+ people back to Earth several light-years away but ends up wasting many years doing so. This allows for an insight into Buzz's one-track mind as it shows that the longer he focuses on his goal, the longer he doesn't realise that everyone around him is growing older while he stays the same age due to the physics of light speed. Buzz is unable to form real emotional bonds with anyone tangible because by the time he returns to base, everyone has either moved on or has forgotten all about him. It's so interesting to see the way this film (and one aimed at children no less) treats the idea of light speed travel as a serious concept and not merely a plot gimmick. I'm not sure how accurate all of the science is in any of this but it all seems pretty well researched for the most part, at least as far as science fiction media goes.\n\nIn stark contrast to the earlier \"Toy Story\" films, which look a bit dated nowadays in terms of presentation, \"Lightyear\" is a beautifully rendered visual treat. I loved the attention-to-detail placed on the character designs, especially on their uniforms. For example, Buzz's space helmet flawlessly reflects some of the gorgeous colours of the cosmos when he's travelling at light speed and the cross-stitching on his shirt looks so realistic. In addition to this, the use of lurid lighting to emphasise the unfavourable conditions of the planet show how inhospitable it truly is, with Buzz and his crew making the most of what they have if they wish to survive. It's a true showcase of how far Pixar have come over the past 27 years, going from a small independent studio making short films to one of Disney's biggest animation juggernauts.\n\nI'll admit I was initially apprehensive at the idea of someone else besides Tim Allen voicing Buzz Lightyear but I think Chris Evans did a great job here. Though at first it sounded weird to hear Buzz with a different voice, I did get used to Evans pretty quickly and in some ways I almost prefer him to Allen. This is because I realised that Tim Allen voiced Buzz with a more light-hearted, comedic tone in the \"Toy Story\" films since he is actually a toy there and not a real person. In this film, Chris Evans voices Buzz with a more serious demeanour, like he's a heroic figure that people need to look up to and respect. That's not to say Evans's Buzz didn't have his own fair share of comical moments, as there were a few scenes of him where he ends up becoming the butt of some jokes due to some of his inexperience. Much like his take on Captain America, Chris Evans strikes a decent balance between sincerity and humour.\n\nThe rest of the supporting cast all had their moments as well, with Peter Sohn as the robot cat Sox perhaps being my favourite. Sox is basically a parody of all those odd robotic sidekick characters a sci-fi film protagonist may have at their dispersal. He is efficient, helpful, and is often used to solve a problem that the others are unable to do so on their own. At the same time though, I couldn't help but shake the thought that he was only added to the film as a merchandising opportunity. With that in mind, I foresee him being a popular toy for kids around Christmas time, maybe even bundled with a Buzz Lightyear action figure as well.\n\nKeke Palmer, Dale Soules, and Taika Waititi also voice Buzz's recruits Izzy, Darby, and Mo, respectively. The three of them are loyal allies for Buzz and it was fun to see how their newer way of doing things often clashed with Buzz's older point of view, leading to some disagreements within the group. Even if some of their scenes fell a bit flat at times, they were all likeable enough for me to care about them whenever they happened to be placed in dangerous situations. If I had to choose a favourite out of the three of them, I'd say Waititi's character Mo was the one I liked most, mainly because he's good at playing those types of clumsy but loveable supporting characters. Either that or his Kiwi accent is just very amusing to me.\n\nTaken completely on its own, \"Lightyear\" is another fine Pixar animated feature that's sure to entertain longtime fans of the legendary studio's work. As a spin-off to the beloved \"Toy Story\" series, it also functions as a nice little quasi-prequel to the first film. Though you might not learn as much about Buzz Lightyear's character as you may have hoped, you can at least see why he's such an appealing hero in the first place. Still, if you've ever liked Buzz Lightyear as a kid or if you happen to have kids who like him, you're bound to find at least one thing to appreciate about this movie, whether it's the visual style, the voice acting, or the science fiction elements themselves.\n\nI rate it

The fact that Chris Hemsworth hams it up alongside his wife is testament to that.\n\nThe fight scenes are fairly decent and there's some decent depictions of violence as well.\n\nIf you go in knowing what you're in for, you may just find yourself enjoying this!",["cheesy","harmless","fun","australian","production","harks","back","bmovie","day","necessary","element","silly","improbable","story","bad","act","poor","american","accent","questionable","special","effect","know","fun","watch","big","budget","action","movie","know","doesnt","try","hide","way","fact","chris","hemsworth","ham","alongside","wife","testament","fight","scene","fairly","decent","there","decent","depiction","violence","well","go","know","youre","may","find","enjoy"],["cheesi","harmless","fun","australian","product","hark","back","bmovi","day","necessari","element","silli","improb","stori","bad","act","poor","american","accent","question","special","effect","know","fun","watch","big","budget","action","movi","know","doesnt","tri","hide","way","fact","chris","hemsworth","ham","alongsid","wife","testament","fight","scene","fair","decent","there","decent","depict","violenc","well","go","know","your","may","find","enjoy"],"Jun",["action","adventure","drama"],["action","adventur","drama"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11604,"indices":[0,5,7,12,13,19,21,24,33,34,35,38,45,58,63,65,85,87,126,135,149,151,157,180,188,204,217,233,287,313,326,346,427,572,596,650,747,759,829,1052,1411,1595,1716,2024,2460,3741,3877,4360,5044,5918,8200,8206],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9578,"indices":[0,4,6,18,19,20,21,28,29,30,34,35,39,61,66,92,101,128,130,138,142,152,161,165,202,211,240,246,306,317,339,347,384,488,534,572,602,683,690,792,882,1072,1371,1660,2001,2380,3769,4087,5142,5176,5227,8618],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[0,1,4],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[0,1,4],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},["Jun"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":12,"indices":[8],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11633,"indices":[0,5,7,12,13,19,21,24,33,34,35,38,45,58,63,65,85,87,126,135,149,151,157,180,188,204,217,233,287,313,326,346,427,572,596,650,747,759,829,1052,1411,1595,1716,2024,2460,3741,3877,4360,5044,5918,8200,8206,11612,11616,11617,11620],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9607,"indices":[0,4,6,18,19,20,21,28,29,30,34,35,39,61,66,92,101,128,130,138,142,152,161,165,202,211,240,246,306,317,339,347,384,488,534,572,602,683,690,792,882,1072,1371,1660,2001,2380,3769,4087,5142,5176,5227,8618,9586,9590,9591,9594],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]}],[34,34,"Interceptor",4.6,"Action Adventure Drama","28-Jun-22","Generic action for exactly that mood","I can understand why some people don't like the movie, as it was a cheesy and generic flick for sure, but not sure if I can understand the many upset 1/10 reviews from people who seem to have taken this personally somehow.

Hopefully, one day some coding hexer will develop an algorithm that can write better, more interesting and entertaining stories, as those human writers are able to write these days.",["art","clone","interceptor","something","like","die","hard","siege","instead","john","mcclane","wie","get","g","jane","like","die","hard","movie","one","also","full","implausible","thing","event","happen","get","bruce","willis","alan","rickman","cast","compensate","plot","hole","charismatic","performance","also","action","fight","scene","way","quality","anyway","production","okay","b","flick","act","solid","whole","story","one","big","cliche","formulaic","generic","affair","therefore","really","dont","know","recommend","interceptor","hopefully","one","day","cod","hexer","develop","algorithm","write","well","interest","entertain","story","human","writer","able","write","day"],["art","clone","interceptor","someth","like","die","hard","sieg","instead","john","mcclane","wie","get","g","jane","like","die","hard","movi","one","also","full","implaus","thing","event","happen","got","bruce","willi","alan","rickman","cast","compens","plot","hole","charismat","perform","also","action","fight","scene","way","qualiti","anyway","product","okay","b","flick","act","solid","whole","stori","one","big","clich","formula","generic","affair","therefor","realli","dont","know","recommend","interceptor","hope","one","day","code","hexer","develop","algorithm","write","better","interest","entertain","stori","human","writer","abl","write","day"],"Jun",["action","adventure","drama"],["action","adventur","drama"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11604,"indices":[0,2,3,5,11,13,14,18,19,24,27,32,33,34,35,44,49,52,53,77,85,96,108,126,132,142,152,177,204,209,228,233,269,292,343,393,400,425,431,461,512,514,542,632,641,709,769,773,835,947,1146,1196,1256,1288,1305,1358,1852,2406,2952,3035,3443,3924,3994,4224,4415,6081,7160,7530,7919,10849],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9578,"indices":[0,2,3,4,10,11,16,18,21,25,27,29,30,39,43,46,48,52,53,72,77,91,113,116,127,128,141,142,158,211,216,223,240,265,268,305,328,388,423,433,463,477,485,521,580,608,700,734,736,813,814,840,901,1170,1276,1295,1318,1437,2245,2633,2994,3045,3290,3337,3878,4171,5397,7051,7668,8171,8376],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[0,1,4],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[0,1,4],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},["Jun"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":12,"indices":[8],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11633,"indices":[0,2,3,5,11,13,14,18,19,24,27,32,33,34,35,44,49,52,53,77,85,96,108,126,132,142,152,177,204,209,228,233,269,292,343,393,400,425,431,461,512,514,542,632,641,709,769,773,835,947,1146,1196,1256,1288,1305,1358,1852,2406,2952,3035,3443,3924,3994,4224,4415,6081,7160,7530,7919,10849,11612,11616,11617,11620],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9607,"indices":[0,2,3,4,10,11,16,18,21,25,27,29,30,39,43,46,48,52,53,72,77,91,113,116,127,128,141,142,158,211,216,223,240,265,268,305,328,388,423,433,463,477,485,521,580,608,700,734,736,813,814,840,901,1170,1276,1295,1318,1437,2245,2633,2994,3045,3290,3337,3878,4171,5397,7051,7668,8171,8376,9586,9590,9591,9594],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]}],[40,40,"Interceptor",4.6,"Action Adventure Drama","04-Jun-22","Watchable grade-B terrorist combat stuff","A B-movie for sure -- the storyline is contrived, the dialog is superficial, and the acting is wooden.

The notable difference here is that the \"hero\" is female! Really? How many blockbuster franchises thrived with the exact same ridiculous plot lines, the Die hard franchise comes to mind, as does the Indiana jones, James bond, etc. Must I go on? Yes, the plot was just as ridiculous as the aforementioned are but I enjoyed it just as much as the aforementioned! The only thing they screwed up on was that the main character was Spanish with a notable accent (i'm not casting aspersions, just saying, and then realizing she's the wife of Chris Hemsworth who's hilarious as the TV sales person, but it really makes no sense, unless you put into the plot that she was adopted as a ten year old or something, as her dad clearly had no accent whatsoever!

The notable difference here is that the \"hero\" is female! Really? How many blockbuster franchises thrived with the exact same ridiculous plot lines, the Die hard franchise comes to mind, as does the Indiana jones, James bond, etc. Must I go on? Yes, the plot was just as ridiculous as the aforementioned are but I enjoyed it just as much as the aforementioned! The only thing they screwed up on was that the main character was Spanish with a notable accent (i'm not casting aspersions, just saying, and then realizing she's the wife of Chris Hemsworth who's hilarious as the TV sales person, but it really makes no sense, unless you put into the plot that she was adopted as a ten year old or something, as her dad clearly had no accent whatsoever!

2",6.2,"Horror","29-Aug-22","Review from the Fright Fest world premiere","On Monday 29th August (a bank holiday in England), the Cineworld at Leicester Square, London was completely packed for this film. They'd turned the air-conditioning on a bit too high, which gave the film an extra edge.\n\nThis film is very gorey. The screening today was Fright Fest (a festival for horror films), so we all loved it. I would definitely not take anyone squeamish to see this. Art the Clown has a particular thing for harming eyes, probably because he knows that we're particularly squeamish about them. He also plays around with the brains and hearts of his victims. He often kills people just because they're there, even if they've not done anything to offend him.\n\nA common criticism of the first film was that the plot was typical of the slasher genre, with teenage girls in trouble and the goody-two-shoes being the Final Girl. The plot is much better this time. I can tell you what each of the characters was doing with their time, before Art turned up, and there was a good thread on the father of Serena and Jonathan. Knowing that they've lost their father makes you feel sorry for them and want them to succeed. In the first film, part of me thought that it'd be funny for Art the Clown to win, but I really wanted to see him get vanquished in this one.\n\nI have some reservations. It is too long, being about an hour longer than the first film. The supernatural element is also a bit muddled. In \"All Hallows' Eve\", Art was clearly supernatural. In \"Terrifier\", you could just about believe that he was human, except for right at the end. In this one, there are supernatural things throughout, but there's never any rules established. I know that film-makers like to keep audiences guessing, but the guessing game is more fun if we have clues to go on. The magic in \"Terrifier 2\" feels a bit too random to make you wonder what's supposed to be happening.\n\nStill 8/10 for the pure horror, despite those reservations.",8,0,1,"Review from the Fright Fest world premiere On Monday 29th August (a bank holiday in England), the Cineworld at Leicester Square, London was completely packed for this film. They'd turned the air-conditioning on a bit too high, which gave the film an extra edge.\n\nThis film is very gorey. The screening today was Fright Fest (a festival for horror films), so we all loved it. I would definitely not take anyone squeamish to see this.

And while the first movie wasn't the most creative, with a light on story and high on violence approach that never differentiated itself any further from your ordinary uber-gory slasher, the character of Art managed to capture the attention and imagination of viewers and critics alike. The silent, but incredibly animated and expressive, mime proved to be a beloved villain through the juxtaposition of his quiet demeanor but loud actions - as they put so succinctly in this film, \"For a guy who doesn't speak, he sure makes a lot of noise.\" Art's shenanigans continue in full force here, giving audiences more of what they expect, but maybe not exactly in the way they expected - \"Terrifier 2\" improves upon its predecessor through its more complex plot, especially as told through its character development of Lauren LaVera's character, Sienna.\n\nA two hour and 18 minute run time is nothing to sneeze at, and director Damien Leone knows this - so he wastes no time in introducing the carnage that audiences expect from Art. Opening with a bloody bang, the film engages immediately, giving viewers just a taste of the madness that is to come. But where the first \"Terrifier\" keeps its momentum through a cat and mouse style rampage that features Art mutilating and murdering everyone in his path, \"Terrifier 2\" slows things down after its explosive start. With an actual plot this time around, contrasting against the original's more proof of concept style, \"Terrifier 2\" takes its time to build plot development through elongated dream sequences and true to life conversations, especially when it comes to the character of Sienna.\n\n\"Terrifier 2's\" final girl, Sienna finds herself face to face with evil itself in the form of a psychotic clown. And you'd think that a basically all good, morally upright character would be a distraction from the film, but her good nature personality actually enhances the goings on, as she is a lawful good protagonist to contrast against Art's chaotic evil. Lauren LaVera was incredible in the role as a fierce heroine who can certainly stand her own against a formidable opponent - I can see her compared to characters such as Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode, and her showdown with Art was endlessly entertaining and narratively satisfying. But alas! If you're watching \"Terrifier 2,\" you're watching it for the over the top violence and gore - so let's talk about it.\n\nWhen it comes to slasher film blood and guts, \"Terrifier 2\" is the real deal - I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this violent in theatres. Art rips people's eyes out, chops people's heads off, flays people alive, and scalps people, just to name a few things; if you are at all squeamish, you should not see this movie. However, if you enjoyed the first one for all of its darkly comedic brutality, you will certainly enjoy the upped ante here. All of the violence is disgusting and hard to watch, but it's all being done by a highly animated and over-exaggerated clown, which makes even the most horrific crimes bizarrely entertaining. You'll find yourself having a sort of sick smile on your face as Art makes his mark, and while you might feel yourself feeling guilty, you can't help but think that the movie is relishing in its carnage as much as you are.\n\n\"Terrifier 2\" is a fun movie - it's by no means high art, and I don't think it is a classic by any means, but Art is certainly a horror icon and watching him in action literally never gets old. While more ambitious than the original, the plot still lacks real narrative heft besides, \"There's an evil clown, and someone has to stop him.\" That said, the simplicity really does give way to some incredible horror set pieces that I will have burned into my memory for a long time.

This is a true story, based on real events and real people. We have the historical data on all of them yet in the movie, they are vaguely mentioned in intro and outro credits.\n\nThe in between or the movie itself is a random series of fights between groups that are not developed well; we feel no emphathy for them, nor do we even know who they are. The movie is also not historically accurate in terms of setting, mannerism, props. It is just generic medieval fighting movie with a backstory that the viewer has to create in their mind as they watch. If you do that, it becomes better sure, but on its own, as a movie as presented, it lacks a lot.\n\nThe events this attempts to cover are pivotal for the time and could have easily been on the level of development we saw in braveheart and gladiator; but alas they opted for shallowness. Acting is not great, not bad but not great, acceptable at best. If it were not based on the true events it attempts to cover, it would have stood better for what it was. Unfortunately the creators trying to make it real life historical completely bombed the pooch here. There was no need for it because there is no history in this movie; none, at all. I guess they felt it added extra importance to the movie by telling us who it was about and what events it tried to convey but that's about it. Few lines on the screen that do not match what we saw, do not a historical movie make.\n\nIt is watchable, just highly disappointing, having ruined such an amazing potential story. I understand it is difficult to properly convey things so far back in history where records were so vague about a lot of things, however look at how other movies approached it. This simply does not even feel in the right time period. It feels a lot like generic sword fight at your local fair ground. Granted the fighting was not horrible but again, without any other context being done proper, it just becomes a generic sword fight movie.",5,0,0,"Could have been the new braveheart or gladiator Instead, it felt generic, rushed with over emphasis on fighting.

We have the historical data on all of them yet in the movie, they are vaguely mentioned in intro and outro credits.\n\nThe in between or the movie itself is a random series of fights between groups that are not developed well; we feel no emphathy for them, nor do we even know who they are. The movie is also not historically accurate in terms of setting, mannerism, props. It is just generic medieval fighting movie with a backstory that the viewer has to create in their mind as they watch. If you do that, it becomes better sure, but on its own, as a movie as presented, it lacks a lot.\n\nThe events this attempts to cover are pivotal for the time and could have easily been on the level of development we saw in braveheart and gladiator; but alas they opted for shallowness. Acting is not great, not bad but not great, acceptable at best. If it were not based on the true events it attempts to cover, it would have stood better for what it was. Unfortunately the creators trying to make it real life historical completely bombed the pooch here. There was no need for it because there is no history in this movie; none, at all. I guess they felt it added extra importance to the movie by telling us who it was about and what events it tried to convey but that's about it. Few lines on the screen that do not match what we saw, do not a historical movie make.\n\nIt is watchable, just highly disappointing, having ruined such an amazing potential story. I understand it is difficult to properly convey things so far back in history where records were so vague about a lot of things, however look at how other movies approached it. This simply does not even feel in the right time period. It feels a lot like generic sword fight at your local fair ground. Granted the fighting was not horrible but again, without any other context being done proper, it just becomes a generic sword fight

Bravura directing.\n\nIf you're not as interested in medieval history as I am this might not float your boat as much as it did me But you will certainly not regret seeing this fantastic and very non-Hollywood movie.",["life","name","impressive","thing","medieval","way","producer","director","commit","try","recreate","world","story","set","realistic","way","everyone","filthy","violence","disturb","little","detail","look","film","set","period","pleasure","obviously","see","ben","foster","michael","caine","screen","though","wouldve","great","interact","rest","cast","first","class","someone","lot","fun","cast","minor","character","also","look","let","us","say","lot","fight","two","battle","scene","stand","fantastically","well","do","grip","bravura","direct","youre","interested","medieval","history","might","float","boat","much","certainly","regret","see","fantastic","nonhollywood","movie"],["live","name","impress","thing","mediev","way","produc","director","commit","tri","recreat","world","stori","set","realist","way","everyon","filthi","violenc","disturb","littl","detail","look","film","set","period","pleasur","obvious","see","ben","foster","michael","cain","screen","though","wouldv","great","interact","rest","cast","first","class","someon","lot","fun","cast","minor","charact","also","look","let","us","say","lot","fight","two","battl","scene","stand","fantast","well","done","grip","bravura","direct","your","interest","mediev","histori","might","float","boat","much","certain","regret","see","fantast","nonhollywood","movi"],"Sep",["action","drama","history"],["action","drama","histori"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11604,"indices":[0,1,5,8,10,13,15,16,18,19,22,28,32,34,38,40,43,53,55,58,61,71,73,76,82,90,104,121,147,149,159,185,186,204,219,235,283,294,313,333,420,421,432,522,537,540,552,600,662,676,699,705,711,715,807,879,906,1184,1205,1423,1443,1919,1928,2183,2644,3114,4112,4671,6619,8434,8509,9974],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9578,"indices":[0,1,4,8,12,13,15,16,18,19,23,27,29,33,34,38,42,52,58,61,64,72,75,78,87,96,98,120,133,156,165,178,180,193,198,207,229,240,261,283,347,348,376,438,441,454,507,573,587,604,657,688,729,751,758,780,806,919,941,1197,1259,1467,1649,1799,1908,2571,3676,4581,5621,6208,8932],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[0,1,14],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[0,1,13],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},["Sep"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":12,"indices":[2],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11633,"indices":[0,1,5,8,10,13,15,16,18,19,22,28,32,34,38,40,43,53,55,58,61,71,73,76,82,90,104,121,147,149,159,185,186,204,219,235,283,294,313,333,420,421,432,522,537,540,552,600,662,676,699,705,711,715,807,879,906,1184,1205,1423,1443,1919,1928,2183,2644,3114,4112,4671,6619,8434,8509,9974,11606,11616,11617,11630],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9607,"indices":[0,1,4,8,12,13,15,16,18,19,23,27,29,33,34,38,42,52,58,61,64,72,75,78,87,96,98,120,133,156,165,178,180,193,198,207,229,240,261,283,347,348,376,438,441,454,507,573,587,604,657,688,729,751,758,780,806,919,941,1197,1259,1467,1649,1799,1908,2571,3676,4581,5621,6208,8932,9580,9590,9591,9604],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]}],[87,87,"Medieval",5.9,"Action Drama History","09-Sep-22","Worth the watch!","If you like films about the Middle Ages, then this one is worth the watch.

Rated R for strong and violent grisly content, you'd expect plenty of slick, professionally helmed action set pieces to drive the plot forward. Instead, you get three or four poorly filmed action sequences that are in between long stretches of horrendously uninteresting and borderline incomprehensible dialogue - but we'll get back to that.

Instead of taking the time to plan for professional choreography, it looks like the filmmakers went to the Olivier Megaton school of directing, deciding to stick the camera as close to the actors as possible and shake it as much as they can in an attempt to trick the audience into thinking they are viewing something exciting.

Forcing the Christian message into this picture feels... awkward. Showing a young man who did terrible things to survive until he was shown a better way (\"amazing grace that saved a wretch like me\") would've surely made a far more powerful and profound story. Instead, Foster (who, though a fine actor, is woefully miscast and woefully misused, trying to deliver a Braveheart performance when kitted out with a Ninja Turtles script) ends up stumbling his way through a GOT version of the Robin Hood myth. This was supposed to be the most expensive film that Czech has ever made but the battle scenes felt surprisingly cheap and disappointingly small-scale, especially considering the fact that during his youth, Zizka allegedly took part (and lost his eye in) the Battle of Grunwald- one of the biggest and bloodiest battles in medieval history. Seeing his mighty wagonburgs and hearing choruses of \"Ye Who are Warriors of God\" (the Hussite battle hymn that struck terror into the hearts of Emperor Sigismund's mercenary crusaders) were pleasant diversions from this hackneyed, melodramatic mess.\n\nThe story of Jan Zizka is a story of faith moving mountains and of a wolf becoming a sheep. As this movie's dedication reads, it is also story about people fighting for their freedom. So, it is sad to see such an inspiring story go the way of the straight-to-DVD release but who knows? With a more native cast (Ondrej Vetchy, one of our most beloved actors makes an appearance amounting to that of a cameo... when I think he could've been and should've been the best Zizka) and a new director (I'm thinking...

All the actors are great in this the Irish sense of humour is class.\n\nGuaranteed to leave the cinema with a smile on your face and have a good chat about the reality of what you just seen if it happened to you whilst your are on your way home whoever you see this film with.",["good","fun","comedy","horror","go","advanced","preview","know","anything","film","thoroughly","enjoy","film","truly","funny","bit","blend","genuinely","harrow","scene","hard","believe","first","act","final","act","film","genuine","fk","moment","stitch","next","breath","bits","almost","like","eden","lake","esk","quite","shock","realistic","manner","actor","great","irish","sense","humour","class","guarantee","leave","cinema","smile","face","good","chat","reality","see","happen","whilst","way","home","whoever","see","film"],["good","fun","comedi","horror","went","advanc","preview","know","anyth","film","thorough","enjoy","film","truli","funni","bit","blend","genuin","harrow","scene","hard","believ","first","act","final","act","film","genuin","fk","moment","stitch","next","breath","bit","almost","like","eden","lake","esk","quit","shock","realist","manner","actor","great","irish","sens","humour","class","guarante","leav","cinema","smile","face","good","chat","realiti","seen","happen","whilst","way","home","whoever","see","film"],"Jan",["horror"],["horror"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11604,"indices":[1,2,4,8,12,16,19,24,28,33,34,38,39,46,65,74,84,96,99,114,117,118,128,132,138,183,194,252,253,317,338,350,433,471,676,755,776,781,807,890,935,1062,1087,1133,1310,1538,1712,1788,1806,2074,3564,3883,4324,4998,5372,5769,9037,9850,9925],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9578,"indices":[1,2,5,13,15,18,21,23,29,34,35,36,39,49,70,76,80,91,104,123,127,132,137,153,173,201,221,238,247,287,338,354,359,389,409,599,729,806,826,829,832,898,1042,1156,1181,1199,1554,1613,1889,1979,3270,3281,3479,3733,3837,4311,6815,6936],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[5],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[5],"values":[1.0]},["Jan"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":12,"indices":[3],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11633,"indices":[1,2,4,8,12,16,19,24,28,33,34,38,39,46,65,74,84,96,99,114,117,118,128,132,138,183,194,252,253,317,338,350,433,471,676,755,776,781,807,890,935,1062,1087,1133,1310,1538,1712,1788,1806,2074,3564,3883,4324,4998,5372,5769,9037,9850,9925,11607,11621],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9607,"indices":[1,2,5,13,15,18,21,23,29,34,35,36,39,49,70,76,80,91,104,123,127,132,137,153,173,201,221,238,247,287,338,354,359,389,409,599,729,806,826,829,832,898,1042,1156,1181,1199,1554,1613,1889,1979,3270,3281,3479,3733,3837,4311,6815,6936,9581,9595],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]}],[113,113,"Unwelcome",4.9,"Horror","13-Mar-23","Ignore the Naysayers","This movie rocks!

Guess it's not too important but couldn't stop thinking about it everytime it was mentioned.\n\nDefinitely interested in checking out Grabbers now though and will check future Wright films out.",["good","idea","could","better","feel","like","potential","much","good","film","good","moment","good","performance","like","colm","meaney","overall","though","isnt","able","pull","real","dramatic","moment","think","stick","go","mad","greatlooking","redcaps","side","note","fear","dearg","translate","singular","red","man","definitely","deal","one","redcap","fir","dhearga","guess","important","couldnt","stop","thinking","everytime","mention","definitely","interested","check","grabber","though","check","future","wright","film"],["good","idea","could","better","feel","like","potenti","much","better","film","good","moment","good","perform","like","colm","meaney","overal","though","isnt","abl","pull","real","dramat","moment","think","stuck","go","mad","greatlook","redcap","side","note","fear","dearg","translat","singular","red","man","definit","deal","one","redcap","fir","dhearga","guess","import","couldnt","stop","think","everytim","mention","definit","interest","check","grabber","though","check","futur","wright","film"],"Jan",["horror"],["horror"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11604,"indices":[1,2,3,4,12,15,20,23,50,52,74,82,107,109,116,140,167,172,264,314,318,319,393,404,426,465,490,509,516,624,680,744,757,879,1144,1157,1931,1973,2073,2121,2561,2891,3873,4183,4774,4994,5636,5938,6696,7290,10403,10875],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9578,"indices":[1,2,3,5,12,17,20,31,43,46,55,72,80,87,115,117,125,139,191,197,299,349,353,362,433,451,491,504,506,527,562,568,669,689,918,967,1223,1336,1531,1977,2800,3797,4594,4742,4971,5065,7244,7642,8190,8408],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[5],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":17,"indices":[5],"values":[1.0]},["Jan"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":12,"indices":[3],"values":[1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":11633,"indices":[1,2,3,4,12,15,20,23,50,52,74,82,107,109,116,140,167,172,264,314,318,319,393,404,426,465,490,509,516,624,680,744,757,879,1144,1157,1931,1973,2073,2121,2561,2891,3873,4183,4774,4994,5636,5938,6696,7290,10403,10875,11607,11621],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":9607,"indices":[1,2,3,5,12,17,20,31,43,46,55,72,80,87,115,117,125,139,191,197,299,349,353,362,433,451,491,504,506,527,562,568,669,689,918,967,1223,1336,1531,1977,2800,3797,4594,4742,4971,5065,7244,7642,8190,8408,9581,9595],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]}],[119,119,"Unwelcome",4.9,"Horror","11-Mar-23","A horror film for horror fans.","This isn't a film with wide appeal, but it's worth a watch by those who love the horror genre as a whole.

I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.\n\nFirst of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!\n\nAbout the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought \"well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours\". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't \"feel\" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.\n\nAnd it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\nFor people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!\n\nDanny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.\n\nThe visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.\n\nBut the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.\n\nAnd as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.\n\nI also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.\n\nI don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.\n\nAnd America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.\n\nSome reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.\n\nWe also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!\n\nI also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and \"their\" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using \"they\" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)\n\nIn conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.\n\nMaybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.\n\nUpdate: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here.",6,1,0,"Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.\n\nAnd you might say, \"well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie\", which I agree with.

I did get a few laughs out, but it felt forced sometimes to be able to enjoy the film.\n\nThe film definitely looked, and sounded, great, but it didn't do enough to grasp a love for the character, or the story. Honestly, I don't think this film was for adults to reach back to the childhood nostalgia, but rather its for a new generation to make the character it's own meaning. Flip side to Buzz was Zurg. Zurg was perhaps the biggest disappointment with how they portrayed him. Who he was in \"Toy Story\" is not the same as who is here, and again, it didn't sit right.\n\nI think the biggest thing is to forget the trailer.

In some ways it reminded me of an inferior \"Up\". The main protagonist's circumstance were less sympathetic and more a result of his actual decisions. Overall I wonder how the movie would have looked if it had explored a B storyline for another character during some of the time-jumps. I also think the twist could have been established a little better than it was.\n\nThe voice acting for the film is fine. I didn't think a lot of the comedy landed well for me. But it wasn't awful like a lot of kids movies either and didn't detract much from the drama of the main story. Overall it will be acceptable to most audiences, with the robot cat being a likely favorite character for many viewers. Most kids will probably like it a bit more than adults and not notice or care much about the politically controversial content unless their guardians have already primed them to have an major opinion about it like them.\n\nI'd say it's a good time at the theater and better than the average score right now of 5.8. But don't expect it to be a classic Pixar film like Coco, Up, Walle, or Toy Story 1-3.</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>The movie is ok.

The score at the time of writing is pretty horrible, and I don't understand. This isn't the best from Disney and Pixar, but it is a great addition and a clever way to tell a new story set in the Toy Story universe. It brings great animation and the array of emotion that we have come to love from the studio.\n\nThe movie lightyear is the movie that got Andy excited for the new Buzz lightyear toy in the universe of toy story. A great sci-fi action flick for both children and adults with a story of friendship, acceptance and the importance of taking a step back from time to time. Chris Evans as Buzz does a great job of capturing the essence of the iconic voice delivered by Tim Allen in the original. The side characters are great and have some fun dialogue and one liners, especially the cat Sox is amazing and next to every single joke made the theater laugh.\n\nThe animation and story is great, but it does feel a bit safe. The animation is stunning but a bit bland at times, and it isn't as colorful compared to other movies, and it doesn't have a distinct style, but stays inside a boundary. The story is good and does have quite a few tear pressers, but it is something you will have seen in other movies before.\n\nLightyear feels safe, not as exploratory and daring as previous Pixar films, but it is a good movie worth watching, especially if you love the original movies. All around it's a fun and entertaining movie, with great humor and a few heart wrenching moments.\n\n7/10.</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>This isn't as bad as everyone is claiming!

But it's not good. As a comedy it fails. I laughed only a few times, almost exclusively at the cat. Most of the jokes were crickets in my audience and a bunch made me roll my eyes.\n\nAs a sci-fi movie it fails. It gives us the most basic child version of several sci-fi concepts stolen from other movies like Interstellar. And if you think for more than a few seconds, so much of it doesn't make sense. There was a cool fight scene and a couple of good action moments, but for the most part I found myself not caring about the action.\n\nThe movie does this thing where it keeps throwing a wrench in the plan, creating obstacles that the characters must overcome. This is normally a good strategy and makes any later success feel earned and satisfying. But every obstacle is a result of dumb characters, silly mistakes, or simply being clumsy. This makes it hard to stay invested. When this strategy is executed better, there is a much better reason for the obstacles, such as a really smart antagonist.\n\nLate in the movie, it goes in a direction that I wasn't a fan of. And we get a few ridiculously cheesy moments, one that made me cringe so hard it hurt. The great animation doesn't make this worth watching.\n\nP. S.

In fact, it was the robot cat, Sox, that delivered all the comedy in \"Lightyear\".\n\nVisually then \"Lightyear\" was rather good. Lots of vibrant colors and impressive details in the scenes.

Sure, it was a little bit odd at first that you didn't have Tim Allen voicing Buzz, as it was in the \"Toy Story\" movies. But Chris Evans did step up to the task and did a good job. The voice cast also includes the likes of Peter Sohn, Keke Palmer, Taika Waititi, James Brolin, Bill Hader and other good talents.\n\nAll in all, then \"Lightyear\" is a wholesome CGI animated adventure for the entire family.\n\nMy rating of director Angus MacLane's 2022 \"Lightyear\" lands on a six out of ten stars.</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>Better than I had anticipated...

use the original movie actors to voice the toys.\n\nThey sometimes hire voice actors (guys like me) who can mimic the lead actors voice for the product that ends up on toy store shelves.\n\nFun fact:

spoiler, but it will blow your mind and fits in with the \"Toy Story\" Universe.\n\nBy the way the on board navigation system \"IVAN\" (navi spelt backwards), Kiwi actor/director Taika Waititi playing

fresh at the same time. Pixar finally found a way to pay homage to its inspiration while also avoiding the the sequel/prequel trope. This film marked a much needed change of pace for Pixar. While not providing quite the thought provoking story we've come to expect from the company, Lightyear still managed to deliver a fun action sci-fi flick with loads of humor.\n\nThe stylization of this film is obviously a notable change from Pixar's previous projects. Pixar provided a more detailed, dark, and grungy style to this film which lended itself well to the film's recurring themes of loneliness and isolation. I must commend Pixar as these themes were handled very subtly and delicately, showing respect for audience members that might be having comparable thoughts or feelings.\n\nLet me just say, this was the perfect film for Pixar to break back into theaters with. This film demands to be seen in theaters or IMAX if possible. Feeling the rumble of spaceships taking off and landing from the theater seat was something that just needs to be experienced. I feel as if this film was directed to be less of a thought provoking piece and more of a good and fun summer blockbuster. It is absolutely filled to the brim with funny moments and quirky characters. Of course, it wouldn't be a Pixar movie without a few tear jerking moments as well. Get ready for a jovial intergalactic adventure with Buzz and friends in this vindicated rebirth of the typical Pixar movie.</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>A Rebirth For Pixar Lightyear felt very nostalgic, yet very fresh at the same time.

I did not count how many times \"To infinity and beyond\" was said, but definitely way to many, I guess due to lack of better punchlines, obviously.

Huge malicious brainless plants and bugs, an even more brainless super intelligent super villain, and utterly stupid but insanely strong robots. The secondary characters, are something of the trio Stooges, but unfortunately not as funny, with only a couple of punchlines which keep repeating over and over again....\n\nThe three stars go for the animation technology, the voice acting and the (strangely enough) not completely wrong physics.....

effects, and innovative sci-fi elements</td><td>\"Lightyear\" is the 26th CGI animated film by Disney Pixar and a spin-off of the \"Toy Story\" series. Featuring the voices of Chris Evans, Keke Palmer, and Taika Waititi, it is a fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements.\n\nSomewhere in outer space, test pilot Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Chris Evans) accidentally causes the crew of his exploration team to be stranded on a hostile planet. With the Earth millions of light-years away, Buzz urgently tries to find a method of transportation to allow him and his crew a safe passage home, though repeated setbacks cause his research to take several years. As time passes by, Buzz soon finds himself joined by a robot companion cat named Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn) and a group of enthusiastic recruits who attempt to aid him in this massive undertaking. To make matters more difficult, a large army of dangerous robots suddenly appear to steal an important fuel source from Buzz and his new friends in order to appease their imposing commander Zurg (voiced by James Brolin).\n\nThe original \"Toy Story\" holds the distinction of being the very first movie I remember seeing at the cinema all the way back in 1995. As a result, I've always had a soft spot for this series and all of its characters. Like most children at the time, I was captivated by the toys of Woody the cowboy doll and Buzz Lightyear the astronaut action figure, the latter of which caused me to ask my parents to buy me one immediately after my initial viewing of the film (they didn't, but I ended up getting one for my birthday later on). There was always something so fascinating to me about Buzz Lightyear's origins, not necessarily as a toy but as an in-universe character, and now in \"Lightyear\", Pixar has finally provided a proper origin story to one of their most recognisable heroes in a film entertains as both an enjoyable sci-fi adventure and a solid spin-off to the original set of movies.\n\nIt is established right away that this film exists within the \"Toy Story\" universe as the favourite movie of Andy, the kid owner of both Buzz and Woody, making it something of a \"movie-within-a-movie\". Because of this, there are no references to anybody being a sentient toy or the canon of the preceding four films. Instead, this is a relatively straightforward story about the origin of Buzz Lightyear as a rookie explorer who hasn't yet attained the rank of Space Ranger. I like this approach because it allows the audience to discard any concern that it could change too much of what has already been established and simply enjoy it for what it is. With that said, there are some cleverly veiled allusions to the four movies scattered throughout in the form of quotes and visual cues. I'm not going to say what they were at the risk of revealing spoilers but I'm sure keen-eyed and keen-eared fans should notice them right away.\n\nWhile this may not be the first Pixar film to feature outer space as its main setting (see \"WALL-E\"), it still manages to use it as a great location for our main character to show off some intriguing personality traits not seen before in the \"Toy Story\" movies. We see that Buzz needs to create an efficient fuel source capable of transporting his entire crew of 1000+ people back to Earth several light-years away but ends up wasting many years doing so. This allows for an insight into Buzz's one-track mind as it shows that the longer he focuses on his goal, the longer he doesn't realise that everyone around him is growing older while he stays the same age due to the physics of light speed. Buzz is unable to form real emotional bonds with anyone tangible because by the time he returns to base, everyone has either moved on or has forgotten all about him. It's so interesting to see the way this film (and one aimed at children no less) treats the idea of light speed travel as a serious concept and not merely a plot gimmick. I'm not sure how accurate all of the science is in any of this but it all seems pretty well researched for the most part, at least as far as science fiction media goes.\n\nIn stark contrast to the earlier \"Toy Story\" films, which look a bit dated nowadays in terms of presentation, \"Lightyear\" is a beautifully rendered visual treat. I loved the attention-to-detail placed on the character designs, especially on their uniforms. For example, Buzz's space helmet flawlessly reflects some of the gorgeous colours of the cosmos when he's travelling at light speed and the cross-stitching on his shirt looks so realistic. In addition to this, the use of lurid lighting to emphasise the unfavourable conditions of the planet show how inhospitable it truly is, with Buzz and his crew making the most of what they have if they wish to survive. It's a true showcase of how far Pixar have come over the past 27 years, going from a small independent studio making short films to one of Disney's biggest animation juggernauts.\n\nI'll admit I was initially apprehensive at the idea of someone else besides Tim Allen voicing Buzz Lightyear but I think Chris Evans did a great job here. Though at first it sounded weird to hear Buzz with a different voice, I did get used to Evans pretty quickly and in some ways I almost prefer him to Allen. This is because I realised that Tim Allen voiced Buzz with a more light-hearted, comedic tone in the \"Toy Story\" films since he is actually a toy there and not a real person. In this film, Chris Evans voices Buzz with a more serious demeanour, like he's a heroic figure that people need to look up to and respect. That's not to say Evans's Buzz didn't have his own fair share of comical moments, as there were a few scenes of him where he ends up becoming the butt of some jokes due to some of his inexperience. Much like his take on Captain America, Chris Evans strikes a decent balance between sincerity and humour.\n\nThe rest of the supporting cast all had their moments as well, with Peter Sohn as the robot cat Sox perhaps being my favourite. Sox is basically a parody of all those odd robotic sidekick characters a sci-fi film protagonist may have at their dispersal. He is efficient, helpful, and is often used to solve a problem that the others are unable to do so on their own. At the same time though, I couldn't help but shake the thought that he was only added to the film as a merchandising opportunity. With that in mind, I foresee him being a popular toy for kids around Christmas time, maybe even bundled with a Buzz Lightyear action figure as well.\n\nKeke Palmer, Dale Soules, and Taika Waititi also voice Buzz's recruits Izzy, Darby, and Mo, respectively. The three of them are loyal allies for Buzz and it was fun to see how their newer way of doing things often clashed with Buzz's older point of view, leading to some disagreements within the group. Even if some of their scenes fell a bit flat at times, they were all likeable enough for me to care about them whenever they happened to be placed in dangerous situations. If I had to choose a favourite out of the three of them, I'd say Waititi's character Mo was the one I liked most, mainly because he's good at playing those types of clumsy but loveable supporting characters. Either that or his Kiwi accent is just very amusing to me.\n\nTaken completely on its own, \"Lightyear\" is another fine Pixar animated feature that's sure to entertain longtime fans of the legendary studio's work. As a spin-off to the beloved \"Toy Story\" series, it also functions as a nice little quasi-prequel to the first film. Though you might not learn as much about Buzz Lightyear's character as you may have hoped, you can at least see why he's such an appealing hero in the first place. Still, if you've ever liked Buzz Lightyear as a kid or if you happen to have kids who like him, you're bound to find at least one thing to appreciate about this movie, whether it's the visual style, the voice acting, or the science fiction elements themselves.\n\nI rate it 8/10.</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>A fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements \"Lightyear\" is the 26th CGI animated film by Disney Pixar and a spin-off of the \"Toy Story\" series.

two bases designated to stop inbound nuclear missiles from Russia. One is a military base in Alaska, no doubt guarded by plenty of heavily armed soldiers, plenty of security counter measures to stop people getting in and teams of backup in case of any problems. The other is a precarious floating rig, with a handful of missile batteries, that doesn't appear to have any defences or counter measures, and the nearest support is an hour away. From that set up, the bad guys we see in the film have really over complicated their plans. All they want to do is disable the interceptor rocket batteries, yet are stoic in following through their own plan, which is guarded by Captain J. J. Collins (Elsa Pataky), who is equally single minded in her objective, in the standard lone action hero way.\n\nMore bizarrely to all that, we have Chris Hemsworth providing comic interludes. Did the mildly simmering tension really need that?\n\nNot really. The scenario is a claustrophobic set, resulting in intense and brutal fights, with basically the one goal that's in the title. Forget any notion of checking to see if the rest of the ships crew are alive (we told you we used nerve gas and shot them all, but maybe we didn't...), she has one mission and will carry it out. Tim Wong (who's also the films fight coordinator) as Zhang and Ingrid Kleinig (who's also the films second unit director) as Kira are most known for their stunt work, so it's no surprise that they are involved in some of the more physical acts. Steven A. Davis as Nikolai is also the films assistant fight coordinator, though he's not that active in fighting. Emotional support comes from Mayen Mehta as Corporal Rahul Shah playing the introverted subordinate soldier - a turtle owning family man - while Rhys Muldoon as Lieutenant Colonel Clark Marshall fills in the emotional back story about how the Captain has suffered in her career, with Belinda Jombwe as Ensign Washington giving a brief motivational speech . That seems to be the take away from the film; all the main characters feel/should feel wronged by the system, and it's how they deal with those feelings that separates which side their on.\n\nThe set is very minimal and the CGI reminiscent of 80's VHS stuff - it gets the story where it needs to go - while the soundtrack accents the vision; you can watch with subtitles and know something is going to happen by the \"tense instrumental music\".\n\nIMDB also have Ali Kadhim as Dark Cloud (Japanese Sword Guy), yet he's not included in the films credits (and I don't remember him in the film). Maybe the producers thought that was one cliche too far?</td><td>3</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>Cliches and tropes aplenty The opening blurb tells us America has two bases designated to stop inbound nuclear missiles from Russia.

The fact that Chris Hemsworth hams it up alongside his wife is testament to that.\n\nThe fight scenes are fairly decent and there's some decent depictions of violence as well.\n\nIf you go in knowing what you're in for, you may just find yourself enjoying this!</td><td>List(cheesy, harmless, fun, australian, production, harks, back, bmovie, day, necessary, element, silly, improbable, story, bad, act, poor, american, accent, questionable, special, effect, know, fun, watch, big, budget, action, movie, know, doesnt, try, hide, way, fact, chris, hemsworth, ham, alongside, wife, testament, fight, scene, fairly, decent, there, decent, depiction, violence, well, go, know, youre, may, find, enjoy)</td><td>List(cheesi, harmless, fun, australian, product, hark, back, bmovi, day, necessari, element, silli, improb, stori, bad, act, poor, american, accent, question, special, effect, know, fun, watch, big, budget, action, movi, know, doesnt, tri, hide, way, fact, chris, hemsworth, ham, alongsid, wife, testament, fight, scene, fair, decent, there, decent, depict, violenc, well, go, know, your, may, find, enjoy)</td><td>Jun</td><td>List(action, adventure, drama)</td><td>List(action, adventur, drama)</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 11604, indices -> List(0, 5, 7, 12, 13, 19, 21, 24, 33, 34, 35, 38, 45, 58, 63, 65, 85, 87, 126, 135, 149, 151, 157, 180, 188, 204, 217, 233, 287, 313, 326, 346, 427, 572, 596, 650, 747, 759, 829, 1052, 1411, 1595, 1716, 2024, 2460, 3741, 3877, 4360, 5044, 5918, 8200, 8206), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 9578, indices -> List(0, 4, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 34, 35, 39, 61, 66, 92, 101, 128, 130, 138, 142, 152, 161, 165, 202, 211, 240, 246, 306, 317, 339, 347, 384, 488, 534, 572, 602, 683, 690, 792, 882, 1072, 1371, 1660, 2001, 2380, 3769, 4087, 5142, 5176, 5227, 8618), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 17, indices -> List(0, 1, 4), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 17, indices -> List(0, 1, 4), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>List(Jun)</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 12, indices -> List(8), values -> List(1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 11633, indices -> List(0, 5, 7, 12, 13, 19, 21, 24, 33, 34, 35, 38, 45, 58, 63, 65, 85, 87, 126, 135, 149, 151, 157, 180, 188, 204, 217, 233, 287, 313, 326, 346, 427, 572, 596, 650, 747, 759, 829, 1052, 1411, 1595, 1716, 2024, 2460, 3741, 3877, 4360, 5044, 5918, 8200, 8206, 11612, 11616, 11617, 11620), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 9607, indices -> List(0, 4, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 34, 35, 39, 61, 66, 92, 101, 128, 130, 138, 142, 152, 161, 165, 202, 211, 240, 246, 306, 317, 339, 347, 384, 488, 534, 572, 602, 683, 690, 792, 882, 1072, 1371, 1660, 2001, 2380, 3769, 4087, 5142, 5176, 5227, 8618, 9586, 9590, 9591, 9594), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>34</td><td>Interceptor</td><td>4.6</td><td>Action Adventure Drama</td><td>28-Jun-22</td><td>Generic action for exactly that mood</td><td>I can understand why some people don't like the movie, as it was a cheesy and generic flick for sure, but not sure if I can understand the many upset 1/10 reviews from people who seem to have taken this personally somehow.

But I figured, since this was actually on Netflix, that I might chance it and watch what writers Matthew Reilly and Stuart Beattie had to offer with \"Interceptor\".\n\nAnd now that I have seen \"Interceptor\", I will say that this movie was actually surprisingly good. This felt and looked like a good old 1980s and 1990s action movie, you know the ones that had the likes of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, and so forth on the cast list. So if you enjoyed the action movies of the 1980s and 1990s, then you most certainly will also enjoy \"Interceptor\".\n\nThe storyline told in \"Interceptor\", as written by Matthew Reilly and Stuart Beattie, is pretty straight forward, if not actually generic in concept and idea, but it hardly matters because \"Interceptor\" was an enjoyable and entertaining movie. It had all the elements that you needed in an action movie such as this. And that means that the fact of you knowing how the movie will end hardly mattered, as the ride from the beginning to the end was enjoyable.\n\nNow, I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble that were a part of \"Interceptor\", but they had gotten together a good collection of talents for the movie. The leading performers, Elsa Pataky and Luke Bracey, were nicely cast for the movie. Well, the part about being all unfamiliar cast members was a bit of an overstatement, as the movie actually had Chris Hemsworth on an uncredited role.\n\nI have to say that I was genuinely entertained by \"Interceptor\", and it is certainly a movie that is well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. Sure, the movie doesn't have enough contents to be an action movie classic, nor does it have enough contents to support more than a single viewing, but trust me when I say it is worth watching.\n\n\"Interceptor\" is a movie that is crammed with enough one liners and clichés to put on a smile on the lips of the 1980s and 1990s action movies for sure.\n\nMy rating of director Matthew Reilly's \"Interceptor\" lands on a six out of ten stars.</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>Good old fashioned action movie...

And in addition to the icky practical effects, it also has what's been missing in most genre offerings as of late: a wicked sense of humor. Art the Clown is possibly this generations' \"Freddy\".\n\n\"Terrifier 2\" also relies on old-school suspense and has an internal logic that keeps suspension of disbelief in check- at least until the film crosses over into the surreal. The supporting teen protagonists, while disposable of course, are less cloying than in other films of this type, and personally I was bummed when at least a few of them met their very very grisly demise.\n\nUnfortunately, Leone shifts gears at the 2-hour mark and introduces a new plot development that proves a real head-scratcher. I am not sure why he didn't save it until the next installment, because it drags the film out for too long (maybe there is an unspoken rule in Hollywood that \"longer running time means better\"?).\n\nI suspect everybody involved in Terrifier 2's production had a blast making it and, aside from its last 30 minutes or so, audiences will too.\n\n*****Final note: If, like me, you were concerned that the gore factor might be too much to take, you can rest assured that the kills are so over-the-top, unrealistic, and cartoonish, that it plays out more like a horror/comedy than disturbing torture porn.</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Campy Fun Like the original, 'Terrifier 2' is pure grand guignol, a spunky 80's horror throwback whose excesses walk the fine line between tongue-in-cheek and exploitation- sure to leave gorehounds and slasher fans shocked and amused in equal measure.

The supporting teen protagonists, while disposable of course, are less cloying than in other films of this type, and personally I was bummed when at least a few of them met their very very grisly demise.\n\nUnfortunately, Leone shifts gears at the 2-hour mark and introduces a new plot development that proves a real head-scratcher. I am not sure why he didn't save it until the next installment, because it drags the film out for too long (maybe there is an unspoken rule in Hollywood that \"longer running time means better\"?).\n\nI suspect everybody involved in Terrifier 2's production had a blast making it and, aside from its last 30 minutes or so, audiences will too.\n\n*****Final note: If, like me, you were concerned that the gore factor might be too much to take, you can rest assured that the kills are so over-the-top, unrealistic, and cartoonish, that it plays out more like a horror/comedy than disturbing torture porn.</td><td>List(campy, fun, like, original, terrifier, pure, grand, guignol, spunky, horror, throwback, whose, excess, walk, fine, line, tongueincheek, exploitation, sure, leave,

The plot is much better this time. I can tell you what each of the characters was doing with their time, before Art turned up, and there was a good thread on the father of Serena and Jonathan.

And while the first movie wasn't the most creative, with a light on story and high on violence approach that never differentiated itself any further from your ordinary uber-gory slasher, the character of Art managed to capture the attention and imagination of viewers and critics alike. The silent, but incredibly animated and expressive, mime proved to be a beloved villain through the juxtaposition of his quiet demeanor but loud actions - as they put so succinctly in this film, \"For a guy who doesn't speak, he sure makes a lot of noise.\" Art's shenanigans continue in full force here, giving audiences more of what they expect, but maybe not exactly in the way they expected - \"Terrifier 2\" improves upon its predecessor through its more complex plot, especially as told through its character development of Lauren LaVera's character, Sienna.\n\nA two hour and 18 minute run time is nothing to sneeze at, and director Damien Leone knows this - so he wastes no time in introducing the carnage that audiences expect from Art. Opening with a bloody bang, the film engages immediately, giving viewers just a taste of the madness that is to come. But where the first \"Terrifier\" keeps its momentum through a cat and mouse style rampage that features Art mutilating and murdering everyone in his path, \"Terrifier 2\" slows things down after its explosive start. With an actual plot this time around, contrasting against the original's more proof of concept style, \"Terrifier 2\" takes its time to build plot development through elongated dream sequences and true to life conversations, especially when it comes to the character of Sienna.\n\n\"Terrifier 2's\" final girl, Sienna finds herself face to face with evil itself in the form of a psychotic clown. And you'd think that a basically all good, morally upright character would be a distraction from the film, but her good nature personality actually enhances the goings on, as she is a lawful good protagonist to contrast against Art's chaotic evil. Lauren LaVera was incredible in the role as a fierce heroine who can certainly stand her own against a formidable opponent - I can see her compared to characters such as Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode, and her showdown with Art was endlessly entertaining and narratively satisfying. But alas! If you're watching \"Terrifier 2,\" you're watching it for the over the top violence and gore - so let's talk about it.\n\nWhen it comes to slasher film blood and guts, \"Terrifier 2\" is the real deal - I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this violent in theatres. Art rips people's eyes out, chops people's heads off, flays people alive, and scalps people, just to name a few things; if you are at all squeamish, you should not see this movie. However, if you enjoyed the first one for all of its darkly comedic brutality, you will certainly enjoy the upped ante here. All of the violence is disgusting and hard to watch, but it's all being done by a highly animated and over-exaggerated clown, which makes even the most horrific crimes bizarrely entertaining. You'll find yourself having a sort of sick smile on your face as Art makes his mark, and while you might feel yourself feeling guilty, you can't help but think that the movie is relishing in its carnage as much as you are.\n\n\"Terrifier 2\" is a fun movie - it's by no means high art, and I don't think it is a classic by any means, but Art is certainly a horror icon and watching him in action literally never gets old. While more ambitious than the original, the plot still lacks real narrative heft besides, \"There's an evil clown, and someone has to stop him.\" That said, the simplicity really does give way to some incredible horror set pieces that I will have burned into my memory for a long time. If you're a fan of the first film, or even if you're not and you are simply a fan of horror, you have to give this one a watch.</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Art is a new horror icon With practically double the runtime of the original film, Damien Leone's \"Terrifier 2\" sets out to be a more lengthy, ambitious, and terrifying movie than \"Terrifier,\" the film that started it all through the memorable introduction of a new horror icon in Art The Clown.

thought the main character was done quite well, he was interesting and creepy with just enough quirk to him to not be a rip off of previous clown killers.\n\nWith this movie I think they really went all out to deliver the slasher, it's exactly what you would expect, gruesome, bad ass, and it uses practical effects which while to some may be a bit cheesy, to me reminded me of the good old days. As well as all of this they have a female lead that is acted well, written well, and delivers enough punch to make the audience root for her. Really well done guys. Good Job with this one.\n\nI'd watched Halloween Kills a few days ago, what an utter disappointment that was, this perked me up a little because it showed that creators are still out there that are willing to give the audience what they want. This is certainly a little more supernatural than the previous rendition, but that's fine by me as it's carried off with just enough cheese to make it what it should be. Reminded me a lot of the golden days of horror in the 80's and early 90's. It maintains that feel throughout without ever feeling like a stranger things wannabe.\n\nWhoever the heroine is in this btw, more of her please, her acting was perfect throughout.</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>If you're disappointed by Halloween Kills, watch this.

The dialog between or among the characters sometimes was too low or too vague to be heard clearly, and most of the time was blocked by the annoying loud soundtrack which supposedly should be in the background and subtle enough to support the ongoing of the story, but sadly, the music often played too loud and over-the-top dominant over the scenes, and lot of times too religiously annoying. It also made me wonder if the production team hired a qualified enough audio professional group to handle the recording or microphone. It seems that there were lot of times, the microphone was placed either too far away or too high to record the characters dialog so that always ended up either too vague or too low to be heard clearly.

Ben Foster did a very good job, but the screenplay didn't give him too much to develop and show the character he played. Michael Caine also faithfully did his part, even it's such a weightless role. Sophie Lowe also acted well for her tragic role in this movie, but luckily, her character was much well developed as the storyline went on.\n\nThe fighting scenes are well arranged, brutal, bloody and realistic enough to make you cringe sometimes.

Ben Foster did a very good job, but the screenplay didn't give him too much to develop and show the character he played. Michael Caine also faithfully did his part, even it's such a weightless role. Sophie Lowe also acted well for her tragic role in this movie, but luckily, her character was much well developed as the storyline went on.\n\nThe fighting scenes are well arranged, brutal, bloody and realistic enough to make you cringe sometimes. Again, the faulty audio almost ruined everything!</td><td>List(actually, pretty, good, unlike, negative, low, rating, movie, almost, make, decide, view, even, finally, decide, give, try, expectation,

There are certain characters whose names are crucial to the plot but these characters themselves are rarely, and sometimes never, seen.\n\nIt's unclear what role everyone is playing in the story because there are so many people to keep track of and the script doesn't properly develop any of them.\n\nNot even the action is particularly exciting.

It's action without weight or a sense of significance.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I felt nothing, because the story concludes without anything of note having changed for either the characters or for the political situation we've been following.\n\nIt's a largely dull experience without clear stakes and without clear goals and without any meaningful depth of character or theme.\n\nI see why there was virtually no marketing for this whatsoever.</td><td>4</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>Convoluted and mostly bland Medieval is helped by a restrained yet captivating performance from Ben Foster.

watching people wage war with spears, battle axes, maces and swords is much more thrilling than gun fights, still love them though.\n\nStraight from the start it reminded me of History's Vikings tv series, if you're a fan of that you might love this as well. I didn't know it's a true story. There wasn't as much character development but I think they didn't have time for that, it focuses more on the story and that was enough to get you invested in the characters by the end. The acting was splendid by the whole cast. A little sad because I have a feeling the movie won't get the recognition it deserves. I think it's better than The Northman in the sense it's paced better and has more story in my opinion, cinematography might not be as great but still pretty good. The fights were amazing and bloody but I thought some gory scenes weren't shown to us, we just get to see the aftermath especially in the first half. There was a lot at stake and I love how you never really know who's gonna make it especially in the third act.\n\nIn the end I love it and remembering these are true events really made the emotional end to it even more heartfelt. Fun watch on the big screens if you're a fan of watching medieval knights bang steel slice through skulls like piñatas. Movies based in the dark era aren't always to everyone's taste but I hope this doesn't go under the radar and people get to enjoy it.</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Jan \"One-eyed\" Zizka I didn't have much expectation heading into this, I just generally love watching medieval films and series purely for the gore; I think watching people wage war with spears, battle axes, maces and swords is much more thrilling than gun fights, still love them though.\n\nStraight from the start it reminded me of History's Vikings tv series, if you're a fan of that you might love this as well.

The Score and Cinematography are both beautifully revealed characters unto themselves.\n\nMedieval isn't 'Gladiator' and doesn't try to be.\n\nIt's a stand alone Biographical Account of one of history's greatest military minds. The movie does well with slightly over 2 hours but could easily have been made into a miniseries or multi-part movie(only a small pivotal point of his life is conveyed in the movie). Some may disagree but as a fan of History this is a story that needed to be told, and told in its graphic realism.\n\nThere's a couple early hiccups in the dialogue but otherwise it's fairly well written and flows evenly after a lagging beginning.

However sometimes low budget movies can be good so I persevered. Unfortunately despite having a semi respectable cast the writers are all over the place. The plot is a confused mess, from priests and noble ladies talking communism to warlords quoting The Art of War the dialogue is anachronistic. The action scenes are poorly filmed and choreographed. I tapped out after an hour realizing I was only half way through hence it gets a single star.</td><td>1</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>A confused mess I gave Medieval a try because I like Ben Foster and it also features Michael Caine and Mathew Goode so at least it has some recognisable actors.

That said, if you decide to see this movie in theatres, you may find yourself perplexed when you begin to realize that \"Medieval\" moreso belongs at the bottom of the nearest bargain bin at your local Walmart. And at the time of this writing, there are four somewhat positive reviews of this movie posted, and it stuns me to see that all of them have rated this movie a 7 or above because, in all of the infinite multiverse, there is no reality where \"Medieval\" should garner a score of that caliber.\n\nWow. I wasn't intoxicated when I watched this movie, but upon walking out of the theatre I found myself unsteady, wobbling from side to side, my head spinning in utter disbelief of what I have just witnessed. It is shocking to me that a team of so-called film professionals not only watched this movie and gave it their go ahead but also deemed it adequate enough to be released to the public at a cinema near you. \"Medieval\" contains many flaws that drag this film down into the dirt form which it came, with its cardinal sin being that it is, simply, boring beyond belief.\n\nYou could go to the park, dig up a patch of grass, plant a seed, spit in the dirt in a futile attempt to water it, throw some soil back on it, and then sit down and stare at the ground for three hours, waiting for your seed to sprout; I guarantee you that that activity would be infinitely more exciting than anything \"Medieval\" has to offer. Rated R for strong and violent grisly content, you'd expect plenty of slick, professionally helmed action set pieces to drive the plot forward. Instead, you get three or four poorly filmed action sequences that are in between long stretches of horrendously uninteresting and borderline incomprehensible dialogue - but we'll get back to that. The action is not well shot; all of it is filmed too close, and too shaky, to be clearly seen and enjoyed. You'll see a shot of someone swinging a weapon, and then a cut to someone getting hit, or falling over - rinse and repeat for every single scene of action in this movie. Instead of taking the time to plan for professional choreography, it looks like the filmmakers went to the Olivier Megaton school of directing, deciding to stick the camera as close to the actors as possible and shake it as much as they can in an attempt to trick the audience into thinking they are viewing something exciting. This lame attempt certainly did not work on me.\n\nBut perhaps the plot is interesting enough to hold one's attention? If you think this is the case, you'd be sorely mistaken! This movie's plot is barely understandable, filled with badly written dialogue, performed by actors whose lines are, half of the time, obviously dubbed over, thus cheapening the viewing experience. A word to the filmmakers: When I'm watching Michael Caine talk and the audio that is coming out of the speakers isn't in sync with the way his lips are moving, and you expect me not to notice or not to care, I feel as if you don't have respect for me as a viewer, so why should I then respect your movie?\n\nBen Foster is fine here - I am a fan of his, but he really had nothing to work with, especially when it comes to the scatterbrained romance this movie introduces, and then promptly drops. At the least, you can't say this was a cheap looking film, as the production value was there; other than that, \"Medieval\" fails in literally every other aspect. Unless you are an insomniac who desperately wants to fall asleep, no one should waste their time in seeing this slog.</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>Medieval?

commanders that history has ever known. He defeated the armoured knights of the Holy Roman Empire with a handful of peasants armed with flails and pitchforks. His armoured wagons (or \"wagonburgs\") laid the foundations for what we now call \"the tank\". He was a legend, freeing the Czech people from the tyrannical popery of Rome. However, he was also a deeply complex individual- the original \"amazing grace\" story. Hacking out a living as a highwayman/mercenary, Zizka's eyes were opened by the gospel of Jan Hus, who taught him how to \"fight the good fight of faith\" before he was tragically martyred. Today, he is perceived as an enduring symbol of Czech nationalism (I nation of which I am fortunate enough to be a member) and his passionate devotion God is overlooked. MEDIEVAL does nothing to mend this one-sided view, with its gratuitous violence, poor dialogue and derivative plot. Zizka become just another gruff-voiced tough guy, unwisely blending his Russel Crowe antics with half-hearted attempts at religious motivation. Director Petr Jakl chose to make a film about Zizka's youth and that's perfectly fine, but Zizka only came to the Lord when he was an old man and had already made most of his mistakes. Forcing the Christian message into this picture feels... awkward. Showing a young man who did terrible things to survive until he was shown a better way (\"amazing grace that saved a wretch like me\") would've surely made a far more powerful and profound story. Instead, Foster (who, though a fine actor, is woefully miscast and woefully misused, trying to deliver a Braveheart performance when kitted out with a Ninja Turtles script) ends up stumbling his way through a GOT version of the Robin Hood myth. This was supposed to be the most expensive film that Czech has ever made but the battle scenes felt surprisingly cheap and disappointingly small-scale, especially considering the fact that during his youth, Zizka allegedly took part (and lost his eye in) the Battle of Grunwald- one of the biggest and bloodiest battles in medieval history. Seeing his mighty wagonburgs and hearing choruses of \"Ye Who are Warriors of God\" (the Hussite battle hymn that struck terror into the hearts of Emperor Sigismund's mercenary crusaders) were pleasant diversions from this hackneyed, melodramatic mess.\n\nThe story of Jan Zizka is a story of faith moving mountains and of a wolf becoming a sheep. As this movie's dedication reads, it is also story about people fighting for their freedom. So, it is sad to see such an inspiring story go the way of the straight-to-DVD release but who knows? With a more native cast (Ondrej Vetchy, one of our most beloved actors makes an appearance amounting to that of a cameo... when I think he could've been and should've been the best Zizka) and a new director (I'm thinking... Mel Gibson, perhaps?), the legend of Jan Zizka may make a glorious return to the screen someday. For now, I just hope Jakl doesn't try to defile his legacy any further.</td><td>5</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???

movies say, Gladiator or Braveheart. It is such a bland, jumpy, not at all epic, with numerous outbursts of explicit violence, which, however, do not save anything. The camera is always in motion during the battles, but the transitions from wholes to details are confusing, choppy, and the viewer sometimes has no idea who is cutting whose body. However, Jákl deserves admiration in terms of production efficiency - even though it is the most expensive Czech film, it is still small compared to Hollywood. The Middle Ages is here as a solidly convincing muddy abomination of history, but the characters are more like running through autumn-colored forests. But above all, the story runs strangely: the power games for the throne are clumsy, opponents exchange prisoners, bands of mercenaries move strangely. It doesn't even look like the $20 million, it's just a bunch of people running around in the woods playing out confusing action scenes. Jákl just describes all the clichés he's ever seen. At its best this it has the energy of an amateur film by friends playing real filmmakers. But most of the footage is hopelessly boring.</td><td>5</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>Maximum drones, minimum emotions Medieval can hardly keep up with movies say, Gladiator or Braveheart.

This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own.</td><td>List(enough, multiverse, maybe, much, madness, sam, raimi, definitely, put, splash, horror, action, film, doctor, strange, multiverse, madness, darker, violent, previous, mcu, movie, could, consider, strength, however, felt, like, enough, multiverse, maybe, much, madness, despite, entertain, visuals, plot, fairly, chaotic, act, dialogue, inconsistent, movie, entertain, ride, little, messy, stand)</td><td>List(enough, multivers, mayb, much, mad, sam, raimi, definit, put, splash, horror, action, film, doctor, strang, multivers, mad, darker, violent, previous, mcu, movi, could, consid, strength, howev, felt, like, enough, multivers, mayb, much, mad, despit, entertain, visual, plot, fair, chaotic, act, dialogu, inconsist, movi, entertain, ride, littl, messi, stand)</td><td>May</td><td>List(action, adventure, fantasy)</td><td>List(action, adventur, fantasi)</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 11604, indices -> List(0, 1, 2, 15, 24, 35, 39, 44, 50, 55, 78, 101, 134, 140, 152, 155, 158, 191, 192, 302, 322, 403, 421, 506, 531, 642, 759, 787, 790, 898, 912, 1022, 1213, 1275, 1529, 1618, 1655, 1738, 5261), values -> List(2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 9578, indices -> List(0, 1, 2, 12, 21, 30, 36, 48, 55, 58, 77, 84, 105, 139, 148, 155, 166, 176, 208, 217, 322, 370, 507, 534, 551, 553, 716, 747, 783, 880, 918, 942, 1071, 1184, 1334, 1511, 1677, 1686, 4126), values -> List(2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 17, indices -> List(1, 4, 10), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 17, indices -> List(1, 4, 9), values -> List(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>List(May)</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 12, indices -> List(10), values -> List(1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 11633, indices -> List(0, 1, 2, 15, 24, 35, 39, 44, 50, 55, 78, 101, 134, 140, 152, 155, 158, 191, 192, 302, 322, 403, 421, 506, 531, 642, 759, 787, 790, 898, 912, 1022, 1213, 1275, 1529, 1618, 1655, 1738, 5261, 11614, 11617, 11620, 11626), values -> List(2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td><td>Map(vectorType -> sparse, length -> 9607, indices -> List(0, 1, 2, 12, 21, 30, 36, 48, 55, 58, 77, 84, 105, 139, 148, 155, 166, 176, 208, 217, 322, 370, 507, 534, 551, 553, 716, 747, 783, 880, 918, 942, 1071, 1184, 1334, 1511, 1677, 1686, 4126, 9588, 9591, 9594, 9600), values -> List(2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))</td></tr><tr><td>126</td><td>126</td><td>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</td><td>6.9</td><td>Action Adventure Fantasy</td><td>09-May-22</td><td>Terrible plot and script, boring and pointless</td><td>I always had some issues with MCU films but now they aren't even entertaining?

Madness</td><td>6.9</td><td>Action Adventure Fantasy</td><td>05-May-22</td><td>Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed</td><td>So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.\n\nAnd you might say, \"well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie\", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.\n\nFirst of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!\n\nAbout the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought \"well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours\". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't \"feel\" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.\n\nAnd it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\nFor people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!\n\nDanny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.\n\nThe visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.\n\nBut the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.\n\nAnd as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.\n\nI also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.\n\nI don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.\n\nAnd America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.\n\nSome reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.\n\nWe also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!\n\nI also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and \"their\" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using \"they\" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)\n\nIn conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.\n\nMaybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.\n\nUpdate: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here.</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.\n\nAnd you might say, \"well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie\", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.\n\nFirst of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!\n\nAbout the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought \"well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours\". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't \"feel\" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.\n\nAnd it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\nFor people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!\n\nDanny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy.

giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.\n\nUpdate: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here.</td><td>List(bald, guy, say, keep, expectation, low, never, disappointed, thanks, watch, early, review, youtube, say, doctor, strange, wanda, movie, multiverse, movie, adjust, expectation,

After defeating the monster, they learn that she is America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), and has the ability to travel through multiverses, and the monster was sent to abduct her. Dr. Strange asks Wong to protect Chavez in the Kamar-Taj with the other sorcerers. Then he heads to visit Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and asks her to help them. But soon he learns that Wanda is the responsible for the attacks since she had acquired the Darkhold and turned into the Scarlet Witch. Now she wants the power of Chavez to meet Tommy and Billy. Dr. Strange refuses to give Chavez to her, Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj and kills many sorcerers and destroys the temple. But Dr. Strange and Chavez accidentally travel through multiverses, chased by the power of the Scarlet Witch.\n\n\"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" is a nice adventure directed by Sam Raimi. The plot is full of action and special effects top-notch, and is highly entertaining. The conclusion disappoints, with the attitude of the invincible Scarlet Witch, but anyway it is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil):\" Doutor Strange no Multiverso da Loucura\" (\"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 2022\")</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Nice Adventure Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) has a weird dream with a demon chasing a teenager and him.

Dr. Strange asks Wong to protect Chavez in the Kamar-Taj with the other sorcerers. Then he heads to visit Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and asks her to help them. But soon he learns that Wanda is the responsible for the attacks since she had acquired the Darkhold and turned into the Scarlet Witch. Now she wants the power of Chavez to meet Tommy and Billy. Dr. Strange refuses to give Chavez to her, Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj and kills many sorcerers and destroys the temple. But Dr. Strange and Chavez accidentally travel through multiverses, chased by the power of the Scarlet Witch.\n\n\"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" is a nice adventure directed by Sam Raimi. The plot is full of action and special effects top-notch, and is highly entertaining. The conclusion disappoints, with the attitude of the invincible Scarlet Witch, but anyway it is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil):\" Doutor Strange no Multiverso da Loucura\" (\"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 2022\")</td><td>List(nice, adventure, doctor, stephen, strange,
