0,0,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,17-Jul-22,Really don't get the hate,It wasn't the best Pixar film but it definitely wasn't the worst. Why it gets such a low score on here I'll never know. I'll admit the trailer did make it look better than it actually was but it was still decent and funny.,7,0,1
1,1,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,19-Nov-22,"It's an okay product, but wrong I.P.","""In 1995, Andy got a toy. That toy was based on a movie. This is that movie. ""

I think I would've gotten more out of this if they'd left out that opening text. ""Lightyear"" is a decent space adventure movie, the visuals are pretty great and Chris Evans gives a strong performance.

But the idea that the Tim Allen Buzz we all know and love came from this movie . . . Eh, I just couldn't get there. There's a bigger ""Top Gun"" vibe going on here than anything ""Toy Story"" related and ""Maverick"" did a much better job of living with failure.

I admit I walked into this with low expectations (really, was anyone asking for this movie?) but the Toy Story association is totally forced.",6,0,0
2,2,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,No signs of intelligent life anywhere....,"6.4/10

The nostalgia was there for ten minutes and then it went away as the story trails away into something that just didn't sit right. While we never got firm info about Buzz's origins in the ""Toy Story"" films. This isn't what I expected for his story. I expected this to be an emotional journey, but there were maybe three moments where a tear was shed. The rest was just ""empty"" space.

The voice acting was good. Chris Evans sounded like Buzz and brought the character to life. The surrounding characters were just as enjoyable. Definitely some funny moments amongst them. I did get a few laughs out, but it felt forced sometimes to be able to enjoy the film.

The film definitely looked, and sounded, great, but it didn't do enough to grasp a love for the character, or the story. Honestly, I don't think this film was for adults to reach back to the childhood nostalgia, but rather its for a new generation to make the character it's own meaning. Flip side to Buzz was Zurg. Zurg was perhaps the biggest disappointment with how they portrayed him. Who he was in ""Toy Story"" is not the same as who is here, and again, it didn't sit right.

I think the biggest thing is to forget the trailer. Go in with an open-mind and make of it what you will. The kids in the theatre seemed to have loved.

Overall, not the outstanding film I was expecting even with all the great visual and sound. The story lacked expectations for a nostalgic character, but wasn't necessarily terrible, so again, go in with an open-mind.

Thank you for reading my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",6,-1,0
3,3,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,30-Jun-22,The movie is ok. Many of this film's reviewers seem nuts,"This film seems to spark a lot of people to say that this film is completely terrible or that it's completely fabulous because it included a gay relationship in the periphery of the main story, and to an even lesser extent, a convict character who is sympathetic. So. I'll address that quickly: None of that seemed like a big selling-point or issue with the movie to me. And those reviewer who make the movie all about those things seem to say more about themself in their review than the movie itself.

Overall I found the movie better than what I was expecting based on it's IMDB score, but still far from being a Pixar classic.

The animation is very good, the story is solid even if it feels like a lot of the ideas have been done before in different ways and feels like a few ideas didn't quite work as well as possible. In some ways it reminded me of an inferior ""Up"". The main protagonist's circumstance were less sympathetic and more a result of his actual decisions. Overall I wonder how the movie would have looked if it had explored a B storyline for another character during some of the time-jumps. I also think the twist could have been established a little better than it was.

The voice acting for the film is fine. I didn't think a lot of the comedy landed well for me. But it wasn't awful like a lot of kids movies either and didn't detract much from the drama of the main story. Overall it will be acceptable to most audiences, with the robot cat being a likely favorite character for many viewers. Most kids will probably like it a bit more than adults and not notice or care much about the politically controversial content unless their guardians have already primed them to have an major opinion about it like them.

I'd say it's a good time at the theater and better than the average score right now of 5.8. But don't expect it to be a classic Pixar film like Coco, Up, Walle, or Toy Story 1-3.",7,0,1
4,4,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,This isn't as bad as everyone is claiming!,"I don't get the bad reviews! The score at the time of writing is pretty horrible, and I don't understand. This isn't the best from Disney and Pixar, but it is a great addition and a clever way to tell a new story set in the Toy Story universe. It brings great animation and the array of emotion that we have come to love from the studio.

The movie lightyear is the movie that got Andy excited for the new Buzz lightyear toy in the universe of toy story. A great sci-fi action flick for both children and adults with a story of friendship, acceptance and the importance of taking a step back from time to time. Chris Evans as Buzz does a great job of capturing the essence of the iconic voice delivered by Tim Allen in the original. The side characters are great and have some fun dialogue and one liners, especially the cat Sox is amazing and next to every single joke made the theater laugh.

The animation and story is great, but it does feel a bit safe. The animation is stunning but a bit bland at times, and it isn't as colorful compared to other movies, and it doesn't have a distinct style, but stays inside a boundary. The story is good and does have quite a few tear pressers, but it is something you will have seen in other movies before.

Lightyear feels safe, not as exploratory and daring as previous Pixar films, but it is a good movie worth watching, especially if you love the original movies. All around it's a fun and entertaining movie, with great humor and a few heart wrenching moments.

7/10.",7,0,1
5,5,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,Not good,"This movie isn't terrible. But it's not good. As a comedy it fails. I laughed only a few times, almost exclusively at the cat. Most of the jokes were crickets in my audience and a bunch made me roll my eyes.

As a sci-fi movie it fails. It gives us the most basic child version of several sci-fi concepts stolen from other movies like Interstellar. And if you think for more than a few seconds, so much of it doesn't make sense. There was a cool fight scene and a couple of good action moments, but for the most part I found myself not caring about the action.

The movie does this thing where it keeps throwing a wrench in the plan, creating obstacles that the characters must overcome. This is normally a good strategy and makes any later success feel earned and satisfying. But every obstacle is a result of dumb characters, silly mistakes, or simply being clumsy. This makes it hard to stay invested. When this strategy is executed better, there is a much better reason for the obstacles, such as a really smart antagonist.

Late in the movie, it goes in a direction that I wasn't a fan of. And we get a few ridiculously cheesy moments, one that made me cringe so hard it hurt. The great animation doesn't make this worth watching.

P. S. The mid- and post-credits scenes are absolutely not worth the wait. (1 viewing, early screening IMAX 6/15/2022)",4,-1,-1
6,6,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,24-Jul-22,Pretty good,Wow I just can't believe the bad reviews. I use imdb scores and written reviews religiously and 95% of the time u think they are spot on. I watched this with my family and we were all very entertained throughout the entire movie. That should say enough. It was pretty well done and interesting.,8,1,1
7,7,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,20-Jun-22,Mediocre,"I enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so of Lightyear. The pacing was decent and the humor/heart was in the right place. Once the twist in the trailer happens the story becomes a beautifully predictable entry for Pixar, and my five year old became incredibly antsy to leave the theater. Socks steals the show but that isn't enough to enliven a boring plot. Wait for Lightyear to stream on Disney+.",4,0,-1
8,8,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,17-Jun-22,Great sci-fi adventure,"It may be Pixar's most straightforward film so far but that doesn't stop Lightyear from being another gorgeously animated installment and a great sci-fi adventure that's thrilling, funny and emotional, with the odd twist and heartfelt message up its sleeve as well.

Chris Evans gives an incredible lead performance as Buzz, honouring what's come before but still finding his own interpretation. Keke Palmer is full of likeable innocence and Taika is great as himself. The standout by far is Peter Sohn as Sox, endlessly adorable and always funny.

The animation is absolutely phenomenal with a lot of it bordering on photo real. Angus MacLane's direction is excellent, there's a clear love for sci-fi present and the world is satisfyingly clunky in the technology. The music by Michael Giacchino is really good, nothing too memorable but still suitably epic and futuristic.",8,1,1
9,9,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,18-Nov-22,"An ok, generic, kids sci-fi movie","First off, for better or worse, this has nothing to do with Toy Story - absolutely nothing.

That out the way this is a well made animated movie about Buzz trying to get home.

There are some really clever ideas here - the main aspect here is that Buzz experiences time dilation every time he attempts a test flight - flinging him into the future.

There are some nice characters and some touching moments as Buzz lives his life outside time.

For the first third of this film I was really engaged and settled down to enjoy this.

Unfortunately, outside of the time dilation, this film is very empty.

The characters run around waving their hands in the air screaming, not really doing much.

When it all comes to the crunch the ending is predictable (I can forgive that) but makes no sense - on any level really.

All that running around is revealed as even more pointless than it first appeared.

This is fine.

You can stick it on and watch it with the kids. There are a few jokes that land and the cat is cute. But in a months time you will probably struggle to remember if you watched this.",6,0,0
10,10,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,It's a mindless action-adventure film and I loved it!,"It's not bad at all.

A side movie within a movie as the text at the beginning states that this movie was released in 1995 to sell the Buzz Lightyear toy in Toy Story.

If you're looking for any Toy Story references or expecting this film to be like Toy Story, think again. In fact, as a Pixar movie, it a little subpair in the usual Disney formula.

What it had going for it is that it's a fast-paced exciting, animated film from beginning to end. It never stops being charming.

I don't know why they decided to replace Tim Allen after 25 years of being Buzz, but I'm not mad at all at what Chris Evans did with the character. KeKe Palmer was also a good voice over but not as good as Uzo Aduba who killed it.

It may not impress Toy Story fan but if you think about as its own thing which in every way that matters it is than it works greatly.

For what it was I enjoyed myself. So worth the ticket price.",7,1,1
11,11,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,20-Jul-22,Solid Pixar movie,"This doesn't feed on my nostalgia for Toy Story. This doesn't feed on my nostalgia for Buzz Lightyear of the Star Command animated series either. But it really seems that, other than the bigots who hate this for their made-up offensive content everyone who hated this didn't like the idea of not catering to nostalgia.

Lightyear is a solid Pixar movie. Simple and entertaining with some important themes. My biggest surprise was Sox the robocat who I thought would be obnoxious from the trailers but was fabulous in the movie.",7,1,1
12,12,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,28-Oct-22,Lightyear is a decent film that overshoots its primary audience and crash lands as a decent movie but with a confused plot focused on adults rather than children.,"Lightyear is a confusing film. It's definitely not bad. It fills its runtime with funny characters and engaging conflict, but the story is a bad choice for a kids' movie. It borrowed Interstellar's time dilation concept and mixed it with an evil future self plot which felt out of place and left my toddler disengaged. I was guessing that Zurg would end up being the rookie from the beginning but who Zurg ended up being was disappointing. I did enjoy the film, but its themes and script felt like a space adventure written for adults shoved into Pixar animated packaging. Lightyear's identity crisis distracted some from the overall film, and its story bit off a bit more than it could chew.",6,0,0
13,13,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,17-Jun-22,Boring,"I saw this in the theater with my 6 year old. She fell asleep and I almost did too...boring, nonsensical, inconsistent, and worst of all, not funny. What was the point?

Should have been free to watch on Disney plus.",3,-1,-1
14,14,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,23-Jul-22,Wow such a low score,"Honest i was not really sure about this movie since its straight out of toy story.

But it delivered and was really exciting, not sure why people are giving it low ratings, and also bad reviews.",8,1,1
15,15,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jul-22,Better than I had anticipated...,"Well, I have to admit that the 2022 Pixar and Disney CGI animated movie ""Lightyear"" was actually better than I had expected it to be. Granted, I wasn't much of a fan of the ""Toy Story"" movies, so I had some reluctance about watching ""Lightyear"". But eventually got to it, as my family wanted to watch it.

And I was pleasantly surprised. The storyline, as written by Angus MacLane, Matthew Aldrich and Jason Headley, was actually rather enjoyable and good. It was a fast paced storyline, though most of the jokes in the dialogue didn't really find much footing. In fact, it was the robot cat, Sox, that delivered all the comedy in ""Lightyear"".

Visually then ""Lightyear"" was rather good. Lots of vibrant colors and impressive details in the scenes. I would actually say that the movie is worth a second viewing just to sit back and take in all the details and touches to the scenes.

With ""Lightyear"" being a CGI animated movie, having a proper voice acting cast ensemble is pretty important, and they did have that for this 2022 CGI animated movie. Sure, it was a little bit odd at first that you didn't have Tim Allen voicing Buzz, as it was in the ""Toy Story"" movies. But Chris Evans did step up to the task and did a good job. The voice cast also includes the likes of Peter Sohn, Keke Palmer, Taika Waititi, James Brolin, Bill Hader and other good talents.

All in all, then ""Lightyear"" is a wholesome CGI animated adventure for the entire family.

My rating of director Angus MacLane's 2022 ""Lightyear"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6,1,0
16,16,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,13-Jul-22,Almost Perfect!,"Honestly, I was quite hesitant seeing this film after seeing a lot of low reviews. I was planning to see it weeks ago and keep cancelling it, then I gave it a chance finally last night. I was initially expecting not too much, but surprisingly, it was good! A lot of emotional connections, wacky comedy and as always, visuals were at its best. If you just go see it, have an open mind and just enjoy the film as is. I do understand why many viewers gave a low rating, the pacing is not that exciting as a whole, need more plot surprises or twists, the tone of the flick is cater for older audiences or young audiences who like a bit a serious tone of animation. Again , go see it, you'll enjoy it!",8,1,1
17,17,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,Not worthy of the 'Pixar' title,"Toy Story is a legendary franchise and Buzz Lightyear might be among the most iconic animated characters ever created. Taking risks and telling an unique story with these priceless assets is therefore a daunting task. A task which Pixar could not fulfill.

Characters in the early scenes of the movie are well written and the relationships well established. The newly introduced characters (which you spend most of your time with) are not. They all got potential, but they fail to connect with Buzz and therefore fail to connect with the audience. The main antagonist has the same issue. He could've been an interesting character, but Pixar went for the easy route instead. This means that we got to see a very generic evil villain, one of which we've seen countless times before.

The plot was predictable. Lightyear never tries to surprise you, stun you, wow you or shock you. You simply go from A to B to C (sometimes with an obstacle in the way) till the movie is over.

Lightyear isn't unique. Lightyear isn't touching. Lightyear isn't worthy of being called a Pixar production.

Except the cat, the cat was incredible.",6,-1,0
18,18,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,18-Jun-22,An origin story no one wanted...,"Let's be clear here: Disney is lying through their teeth. When you buy a Maui doll from Moana, you get Dwayne Johnson's voice. Disney pretending that because it's an origin story it requires a different voice actor is one of the most feeble attempts ever to avoid backlash. If it had been an origin story of Woody, you can be damn sure Disney would have cast Tom Hanks.

With that out of the way, does this origin story of the Buzz toy bring Pixar a worthy return to theatrical releases? Absolutely not. This very much feels like it should have been the third Disney+ release after Luca and Turning Red. The visuals, while not the best from Pixar, are still quite good. Chris Evans does his best to fill Allen's shoes and his performance is palatable once you get over the change. But what is ultimately lacking here is any heart or substantive story. Attempting to be 'real life' events makes the whole plot feel fabricated beyond an already hardly believable story.

There isn't a universe here where I want get lost in, and frankly, I don't think many viewers will, either...",4,-1,-1
19,19,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,What Walts Watching,"In 1995, a boy named Andy got a new ""Buzz Lightyear"" toy as a gift licensed from his favourite movie that year.

""Lightyear"" is the movie about that movie.

This explains why Chris Evans can voice Buzz, because not all toy franchises use the original movie actors to voice the toys.

They sometimes hire voice actors (guys like me) who can mimic the lead actors voice for the product that ends up on toy store shelves.

Fun fact: Evans and Tim Allen, who voiced the character in the ""Toy Story"" franchise, share the same birth date, June 13th, just decades apart.

That said I loved this movie!

It's just pure joy and the animation is first class...wait for the sandwich eating scene.

""Lightyear"" is one of those rare animations that can make you laugh, cry and sigh.

Others that fall into this category are also from Pixar and Disney including ""Up"", ""Lion King"" and of course ""Toy Story"".

There are so many nods to other famous movies in the course of ""Lightyear"", including Star Wars.

You'll have fun just picking them out and discussing all of them with family and friends long after this movie has ended.

By the way do NOT leave till the house lights come on because there are 3 Easter Eggs in the titles.

Interestingly even the name of the movie isn't revealed till the end of the film.

This animation would look great on IMAX...just saying.

""Lightyear is Pixar's first spinoff and second prequel after ""Monsters University"".

The LGBTQ community will be happy to see representation in a children's animation although it is causing issues in some Asian & Middle East countries with refusals to screen the movie.

Whilst others see the relationship as too woke.

Let's face it the creators are simply reflecting real world lifestyle's...same sex marriage is legal in most countries now...even Australia.

Listen out for veteran actor James Brolin voicing his first animated film role in his 80's.

I can't tell you his character because that would a huge spoiler, but it will blow your mind and fits in with the ""Toy Story"" Universe.

By the way the on board navigation system ""IVAN"" (navi spelt backwards), Kiwi actor/director Taika Waititi playing a wannabe Space Ranger and a character called ""Sox"" are all scene stealers.

I liked this movie so much I know I'll watch it again on Disney Plus but it won't be the same as my cinema experience which was so close to perfect.

See this with your whole family because it works on so many levels as great movies should.

To infinity and beyond!",7,1,1
20,20,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,A Rebirth For Pixar,"Lightyear felt very nostalgic, yet very fresh at the same time. Pixar finally found a way to pay homage to its inspiration while also avoiding the the sequel/prequel trope. This film marked a much needed change of pace for Pixar. While not providing quite the thought provoking story we've come to expect from the company, Lightyear still managed to deliver a fun action sci-fi flick with loads of humor.

The stylization of this film is obviously a notable change from Pixar's previous projects. Pixar provided a more detailed, dark, and grungy style to this film which lended itself well to the film's recurring themes of loneliness and isolation. I must commend Pixar as these themes were handled very subtly and delicately, showing respect for audience members that might be having comparable thoughts or feelings.

Let me just say, this was the perfect film for Pixar to break back into theaters with. This film demands to be seen in theaters or IMAX if possible. Feeling the rumble of spaceships taking off and landing from the theater seat was something that just needs to be experienced. I feel as if this film was directed to be less of a thought provoking piece and more of a good and fun summer blockbuster. It is absolutely filled to the brim with funny moments and quirky characters. Of course, it wouldn't be a Pixar movie without a few tear jerking moments as well. Get ready for a jovial intergalactic adventure with Buzz and friends in this vindicated rebirth of the typical Pixar movie.",7,1,1
21,21,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,29-Sep-22,To Infinity and Meh,"Buzz Lightyear's origin story and the same movie that ignited Andy's interest in Buzz from Toy Story. The animation is fantastic and I like the premise of a marooned colony trying to science their way home. Unfortunately the writing falls a bit flat and doesn't do the plot or cast any favors. It's an unnecessary addition to the Toy Story universe, but a solid addition to the Pixar library. I don't like that the main villain's identity is kept secret due to his inability to program his robot army to say more than one word. This revelation is yada yadad over so fast that you might think you jumped to hyper speed. Overall, just okay.",6,0,0
22,22,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,05-Sep-22,A disappointment,"The film tries to become a prequel to the extremely successful toy story line. As such it fails miserably, not due to technical issues, but simply because the story sucks. It is inconsistent, carries nothing but clichés and failed punchlines along, and is full of loose ends, even for five-year-olds.

The main problem is that the hero, the actual Buzz Lightyear (who in this movie is supposed to be a real hero, an experienced space ranger, and above all a real person, rather than a cartoonish toy), has all the traits of the wannabe action hero of the actual Toy Story films, and this simply does not work. I did not count how many times ""To infinity and beyond"" was said, but definitely way to many, I guess due to lack of better punchlines, obviously. Buzz is stubborn, rather than brave, a do-it-all loner, rather than a team capable personality, childish and opinionated, rather than wise and adventurous. All these traits are fine for the toy, which actually does not quite know what the real world looks like, but fail miserably for a real person (in fact I kept asking myself, how this guy could even become a space ranger in the first place...).

If the movie was at least funny, or creative, one might forgive its shortcomings, but unfortunately this is not the case.

The whole plot is an incomprehensible mixture of a cartoonish outer space (where one would expect the black Martian from Roger Rabbit to land any moment), and a B-movie of the space horror genre from the seventies. Huge malicious brainless plants and bugs, an even more brainless super intelligent super villain, and utterly stupid but insanely strong robots. The secondary characters, are something of the trio Stooges, but unfortunately not as funny, with only a couple of punchlines which keep repeating over and over again....

The three stars go for the animation technology, the voice acting and the (strangely enough) not completely wrong physics..... However, Pixar's amazing team cannot compensate for the totally inadequate script.

Watch it at your own risk, with lots of coffee to to help you overcome the boredom (or even better watch something else).",3,-1,-1
23,23,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,16-Jun-22,"A fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements","""Lightyear"" is the 26th CGI animated film by Disney Pixar and a spin-off of the ""Toy Story"" series. Featuring the voices of Chris Evans, Keke Palmer, and Taika Waititi, it is a fun space adventure that makes good use of its voice cast, visual effects, and innovative sci-fi elements.

Somewhere in outer space, test pilot Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Chris Evans) accidentally causes the crew of his exploration team to be stranded on a hostile planet. With the Earth millions of light-years away, Buzz urgently tries to find a method of transportation to allow him and his crew a safe passage home, though repeated setbacks cause his research to take several years. As time passes by, Buzz soon finds himself joined by a robot companion cat named Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn) and a group of enthusiastic recruits who attempt to aid him in this massive undertaking. To make matters more difficult, a large army of dangerous robots suddenly appear to steal an important fuel source from Buzz and his new friends in order to appease their imposing commander Zurg (voiced by James Brolin).

The original ""Toy Story"" holds the distinction of being the very first movie I remember seeing at the cinema all the way back in 1995. As a result, I've always had a soft spot for this series and all of its characters. Like most children at the time, I was captivated by the toys of Woody the cowboy doll and Buzz Lightyear the astronaut action figure, the latter of which caused me to ask my parents to buy me one immediately after my initial viewing of the film (they didn't, but I ended up getting one for my birthday later on). There was always something so fascinating to me about Buzz Lightyear's origins, not necessarily as a toy but as an in-universe character, and now in ""Lightyear"", Pixar has finally provided a proper origin story to one of their most recognisable heroes in a film entertains as both an enjoyable sci-fi adventure and a solid spin-off to the original set of movies.

It is established right away that this film exists within the ""Toy Story"" universe as the favourite movie of Andy, the kid owner of both Buzz and Woody, making it something of a ""movie-within-a-movie"". Because of this, there are no references to anybody being a sentient toy or the canon of the preceding four films. Instead, this is a relatively straightforward story about the origin of Buzz Lightyear as a rookie explorer who hasn't yet attained the rank of Space Ranger. I like this approach because it allows the audience to discard any concern that it could change too much of what has already been established and simply enjoy it for what it is. With that said, there are some cleverly veiled allusions to the four movies scattered throughout in the form of quotes and visual cues. I'm not going to say what they were at the risk of revealing spoilers but I'm sure keen-eyed and keen-eared fans should notice them right away.

While this may not be the first Pixar film to feature outer space as its main setting (see ""WALL-E""), it still manages to use it as a great location for our main character to show off some intriguing personality traits not seen before in the ""Toy Story"" movies. We see that Buzz needs to create an efficient fuel source capable of transporting his entire crew of 1000+ people back to Earth several light-years away but ends up wasting many years doing so. This allows for an insight into Buzz's one-track mind as it shows that the longer he focuses on his goal, the longer he doesn't realise that everyone around him is growing older while he stays the same age due to the physics of light speed. Buzz is unable to form real emotional bonds with anyone tangible because by the time he returns to base, everyone has either moved on or has forgotten all about him. It's so interesting to see the way this film (and one aimed at children no less) treats the idea of light speed travel as a serious concept and not merely a plot gimmick. I'm not sure how accurate all of the science is in any of this but it all seems pretty well researched for the most part, at least as far as science fiction media goes.

In stark contrast to the earlier ""Toy Story"" films, which look a bit dated nowadays in terms of presentation, ""Lightyear"" is a beautifully rendered visual treat. I loved the attention-to-detail placed on the character designs, especially on their uniforms. For example, Buzz's space helmet flawlessly reflects some of the gorgeous colours of the cosmos when he's travelling at light speed and the cross-stitching on his shirt looks so realistic. In addition to this, the use of lurid lighting to emphasise the unfavourable conditions of the planet show how inhospitable it truly is, with Buzz and his crew making the most of what they have if they wish to survive. It's a true showcase of how far Pixar have come over the past 27 years, going from a small independent studio making short films to one of Disney's biggest animation juggernauts.

I'll admit I was initially apprehensive at the idea of someone else besides Tim Allen voicing Buzz Lightyear but I think Chris Evans did a great job here. Though at first it sounded weird to hear Buzz with a different voice, I did get used to Evans pretty quickly and in some ways I almost prefer him to Allen. This is because I realised that Tim Allen voiced Buzz with a more light-hearted, comedic tone in the ""Toy Story"" films since he is actually a toy there and not a real person. In this film, Chris Evans voices Buzz with a more serious demeanour, like he's a heroic figure that people need to look up to and respect. That's not to say Evans's Buzz didn't have his own fair share of comical moments, as there were a few scenes of him where he ends up becoming the butt of some jokes due to some of his inexperience. Much like his take on Captain America, Chris Evans strikes a decent balance between sincerity and humour.

The rest of the supporting cast all had their moments as well, with Peter Sohn as the robot cat Sox perhaps being my favourite. Sox is basically a parody of all those odd robotic sidekick characters a sci-fi film protagonist may have at their dispersal. He is efficient, helpful, and is often used to solve a problem that the others are unable to do so on their own. At the same time though, I couldn't help but shake the thought that he was only added to the film as a merchandising opportunity. With that in mind, I foresee him being a popular toy for kids around Christmas time, maybe even bundled with a Buzz Lightyear action figure as well.

Keke Palmer, Dale Soules, and Taika Waititi also voice Buzz's recruits Izzy, Darby, and Mo, respectively. The three of them are loyal allies for Buzz and it was fun to see how their newer way of doing things often clashed with Buzz's older point of view, leading to some disagreements within the group. Even if some of their scenes fell a bit flat at times, they were all likeable enough for me to care about them whenever they happened to be placed in dangerous situations. If I had to choose a favourite out of the three of them, I'd say Waititi's character Mo was the one I liked most, mainly because he's good at playing those types of clumsy but loveable supporting characters. Either that or his Kiwi accent is just very amusing to me.

Taken completely on its own, ""Lightyear"" is another fine Pixar animated feature that's sure to entertain longtime fans of the legendary studio's work. As a spin-off to the beloved ""Toy Story"" series, it also functions as a nice little quasi-prequel to the first film. Though you might not learn as much about Buzz Lightyear's character as you may have hoped, you can at least see why he's such an appealing hero in the first place. Still, if you've ever liked Buzz Lightyear as a kid or if you happen to have kids who like him, you're bound to find at least one thing to appreciate about this movie, whether it's the visual style, the voice acting, or the science fiction elements themselves.

I rate it 8/10.",8,1,1
24,24,Lightyear,6.1,Animation Action Adventure,18-Jun-22,"Lightyear is far from another incredibly memorable Pixar film, but it's still an adventure filled with tons of entertainment, inspiring messages, and breathtaking animation.","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Lightyear is far from yet another incredibly memorable Pixar film, but it's still an adventure filled with tons of entertainment, inspiring messages, and breathtaking animation.

Angus MacLane doesn't deviate from the studio's well-known formulas, delivering a narrative without notable deviations from the most predictable, safest path. Except for an unnecessary, overly complex twist for the target audience in the third act, Buzz Lightyear and his team take viewers through space on a remarkably immersive audiovisual journey.

The voice cast is extraordinary, most notably Chris Evans - born to play captains - and Peter Sohn - non-stop hilarious as the robotic cat Sox, Disney's most popular new toy-to-be.

I highly recommend to see it in theaters!""

25,25,Interceptor,4.6,Action Adventure Drama,05-Jun-22,Almost unwatchable,"This is one of those rare moments when you should trust the negative reviews. Elsa Pataky was fine in the small roles she had in the Fast and Furious films but she is not an action star and her acting can not support a film on its own. Apart from that the cgi in this is TERRIBLE, it looks like you are watching a direct to video film from the 80s. The writing is awful, the one liners in this are so generic and completely uninspired. The action in this is also very bland and the fight scenes are too repetitive. Nothing about this movie is fresh or entertaining, I'm not sure who the target audience is supposed to be but this is one movie that you should avoid.",2,-1,-1

27,27,Interceptor,4.6,Action Adventure Drama,29-Jul-22,Cliches and tropes aplenty,"The opening blurb tells us America has two bases designated to stop inbound nuclear missiles from Russia. One is a military base in Alaska, no doubt guarded by plenty of heavily armed soldiers, plenty of security counter measures to stop people getting in and teams of backup in case of any problems. The other is a precarious floating rig, with a handful of missile batteries, that doesn't appear to have any defences or counter measures, and the nearest support is an hour away. From that set up, the bad guys we see in the film have really over complicated their plans. All they want to do is disable the interceptor rocket batteries, yet are stoic in following through their own plan, which is guarded by Captain J. J. Collins (Elsa Pataky), who is equally single minded in her objective, in the standard lone action hero way.

More bizarrely to all that, we have Chris Hemsworth providing comic interludes. Did the mildly simmering tension really need that?

Not really. The scenario is a claustrophobic set, resulting in intense and brutal fights, with basically the one goal that's in the title. Forget any notion of checking to see if the rest of the ships crew are alive (we told you we used nerve gas and shot them all, but maybe we didn't...), she has one mission and will carry it out. Tim Wong (who's also the films fight coordinator) as Zhang and Ingrid Kleinig (who's also the films second unit director) as Kira are most known for their stunt work, so it's no surprise that they are involved in some of the more physical acts. Steven A. Davis as Nikolai is also the films assistant fight coordinator, though he's not that active in fighting. Emotional support comes from Mayen Mehta as Corporal Rahul Shah playing the introverted subordinate soldier - a turtle owning family man - while Rhys Muldoon as Lieutenant Colonel Clark Marshall fills in the emotional back story about how the Captain has suffered in her career, with Belinda Jombwe as Ensign Washington giving a brief motivational speech . That seems to be the take away from the film; all the main characters feel/should feel wronged by the system, and it's how they deal with those feelings that separates which side their on.

The set is very minimal and the CGI reminiscent of 80's VHS stuff - it gets the story where it needs to go - while the soundtrack accents the vision; you can watch with subtitles and know something is going to happen by the ""tense instrumental music"".

IMDB also have Ali Kadhim as Dark Cloud (Japanese Sword Guy), yet he's not included in the films credits (and I don't remember him in the film). Maybe the producers thought that was one cliche too far?",3,-1,-1

34,34,Interceptor,4.6,Action Adventure Drama,28-Jun-22,Generic action for exactly that mood,"I can understand why some people don't like the movie, as it was a cheesy and generic flick for sure, but not sure if I can understand the many upset 1/10 reviews from people who seem to have taken this personally somehow. All those reviews read exactly like metacritic review bombs where people are upset over something else than the content they're reviewing... or just rants from people who love exaggerating for drama.

This reminded me of some straight to VHS average action flicks that you'd pick up from the rental place completely deliberately for that day where you just want a mindless movie and as such, it worked very well. Did I laugh and roll my eyes at convenient plotpoint? Sure. But I also expected to.

I kinda liked seeing a female lead for once. Just like male leads powers are always played way up and how John McLane can still run and kick ass after being battered and bruised beyond any reason, just flying away from explosions instead of exploDING, so did she. If your suspension of disbelief fails only on the part of her being a woman, I guess you truely have it ingrained in you that ""women = weak"" and can't even for a moment tune that out in a silly action flick.

This kinda reminded me of some ""Tomb Raider"" kind of deal, with the exception that I actually enjoyed this more than any Tomb Raider movie.

If you are ""tired of feeling like my identity is always attacked by films such as this."", that is just sad. There have been crazy egomaniac villains that have agendas like this in movies for a small eternity and obviously the movie's not saying he's right.

If you are very keen on only seeing agendas in women being shown as anything capable, do yourself a favor and skip it. If you're looking for a generic action flick for a mindless day? Sure, why not :)",7,0,1

40,40,Interceptor,4.6,Action Adventure Drama,04-Jun-22,Watchable grade-B terrorist combat stuff,"A B-movie for sure -- the storyline is contrived, the dialog is superficial, and the acting is wooden. So my rating of 5/10 is probably generous. Nevertheless, I thought it was watchable and it fitted the purpose of having something to look at while I was exercising. Lead actress Elsa Patacky is front and center throughout this movie, playing US Army captain JJ Collins, who as soon as she is assigned to the remote marine base SBX-1 has to fight off terrorists who want to nuke 16 cities and destroy America. Somehow there's lots of money involved. Luke Bracey, as the smarmy leader of the enemies, has an easy way of delivering lines even if those lines are laughably conventional. And, Patacky's husband Chris Hemsworth (who's the executive producer -- what a coincidence) has a little cameo role that's completely meaningless but still pretty fun.

Almost right off the bat, Patacky gets down to action gear where we can enjoy looking at her very well muscled shoulders and arms (and that's kind of the main interest of the movie -- they really are nice to look at). There's lots of hand-to-hand combat and a fairly high body count, with the hero(ine) taking and dishing out lots of punishment and displaying superhuman stamina, but I'd be hard pressed to think of any original twist on anything that happened here. The idea that the US missile defence system depends on a single little remote ocean base that seems about as hard to knock over as a candy store is pretty implausible.

The notable difference here is that the ""hero"" is female! Really? How many blockbuster franchises thrived with the exact same ridiculous plot lines, the Die hard franchise comes to mind, as does the Indiana jones, James bond, etc. Must I go on? Yes, the plot was just as ridiculous as the aforementioned are but I enjoyed it just as much as the aforementioned! The only thing they screwed up on was that the main character was Spanish with a notable accent (i'm not casting aspersions, just saying, and then realizing she's the wife of Chris Hemsworth who's hilarious as the TV sales person, but it really makes no sense, unless you put into the plot that she was adopted as a ten year old or something, as her dad clearly had no accent whatsoever! The other critizism I have is why did the ""Marine helicopters"" never arrive? I mean really? They were promised constantly, oh, they're 90 minutes out (in the beginning, not enough time, then they were supposedly 10 minutes out toward the end and they just never materialized!

44,44,Interceptor,4.6,Action Adventure Drama,04-Jun-22,Good old fashioned action movie...,"Granted, from this 2022 action movie's cover/poster, then I was expecting that I would be in for a low budget action movie, very much in the spirit of the movies you get from The Asylum. But I figured, since this was actually on Netflix, that I might chance it and watch what writers Matthew Reilly and Stuart Beattie had to offer with ""Interceptor"".

And now that I have seen ""Interceptor"", I will say that this movie was actually surprisingly good. This felt and looked like a good old 1980s and 1990s action movie, you know the ones that had the likes of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, and so forth on the cast list. So if you enjoyed the action movies of the 1980s and 1990s, then you most certainly will also enjoy ""Interceptor"".

The storyline told in ""Interceptor"", as written by Matthew Reilly and Stuart Beattie, is pretty straight forward, if not actually generic in concept and idea, but it hardly matters because ""Interceptor"" was an enjoyable and entertaining movie. It had all the elements that you needed in an action movie such as this. And that means that the fact of you knowing how the movie will end hardly mattered, as the ride from the beginning to the end was enjoyable.

Now, I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble that were a part of ""Interceptor"", but they had gotten together a good collection of talents for the movie. The leading performers, Elsa Pataky and Luke Bracey, were nicely cast for the movie. Well, the part about being all unfamiliar cast members was a bit of an overstatement, as the movie actually had Chris Hemsworth on an uncredited role.

I have to say that I was genuinely entertained by ""Interceptor"", and it is certainly a movie that is well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch. Sure, the movie doesn't have enough contents to be an action movie classic, nor does it have enough contents to support more than a single viewing, but trust me when I say it is worth watching.

""Interceptor"" is a movie that is crammed with enough one liners and clichés to put on a smile on the lips of the 1980s and 1990s action movies for sure.

My rating of director Matthew Reilly's ""Interceptor"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6,1,0

And in addition to the icky practical effects, it also has what's been missing in most genre offerings as of late: a wicked sense of humor. Art the Clown is possibly this generations' ""Freddy"".

""Terrifier 2"" also relies on old-school suspense and has an internal logic that keeps suspension of disbelief in check- at least until the film crosses over into the surreal. The supporting teen protagonists, while disposable of course, are less cloying than in other films of this type, and personally I was bummed when at least a few of them met their very very grisly demise.

Unfortunately, Leone shifts gears at the 2-hour mark and introduces a new plot development that proves a real head-scratcher. I am not sure why he didn't save it until the next installment, because it drags the film out for too long (maybe there is an unspoken rule in Hollywood that ""longer running time means better""?).

I suspect everybody involved in Terrifier 2's production had a blast making it and, aside from its last 30 minutes or so, audiences will too.

57,57,Terrifier 2,6.2,Horror,29-Aug-22,Review from the Fright Fest world premiere,"On Monday 29th August (a bank holiday in England), the Cineworld at Leicester Square, London was completely packed for this film. They'd turned the air-conditioning on a bit too high, which gave the film an extra edge.

This film is very gorey. The screening today was Fright Fest (a festival for horror films), so we all loved it. I would definitely not take anyone squeamish to see this. Art the Clown has a particular thing for harming eyes, probably because he knows that we're particularly squeamish about them. He also plays around with the brains and hearts of his victims. He often kills people just because they're there, even if they've not done anything to offend him.

A common criticism of the first film was that the plot was typical of the slasher genre, with teenage girls in trouble and the goody-two-shoes being the Final Girl. The plot is much better this time. I can tell you what each of the characters was doing with their time, before Art turned up, and there was a good thread on the father of Serena and Jonathan. Knowing that they've lost their father makes you feel sorry for them and want them to succeed. In the first film, part of me thought that it'd be funny for Art the Clown to win, but I really wanted to see him get vanquished in this one.

I have some reservations. It is too long, being about an hour longer than the first film. The supernatural element is also a bit muddled. In ""All Hallows' Eve"", Art was clearly supernatural. In ""Terrifier"", you could just about believe that he was human, except for right at the end. In this one, there are supernatural things throughout, but there's never any rules established. I know that film-makers like to keep audiences guessing, but the guessing game is more fun if we have clues to go on. The magic in ""Terrifier 2"" feels a bit too random to make you wonder what's supposed to be happening.

Still 8/10 for the pure horror, despite those reservations.",8,0,1

Now the plot is pretty weak and makes no sense and its a little long to be a slasher but to me that doesnt hinder from the actual spectacle of the film which is the gore and practical effects.

If youre looking for a good storyline and plot youll be pretty disappointed. But if you want to see just mindless death and absurd over the top gore this is highly recommended!",8,1,1

62,62,Terrifier 2,6.2,Horror,07-Oct-22,Mindless entertainment,Kinda cool Terrifer 2 had a theater release yet very fun pure horror entrainment! Easily one of the most gruesome horror films I ever seen I don't know how they make it seem so real special effects/ practical effects had a football field size of dead bodies for the film. A lot of memorable scenes and madness; it's a very cool movie despite the flaws. Felt like nightmare fuel throughout I wonder how Damien Leone came up with such morbid filled horror. Lastly at the theater when finished there was ambulance and police for someone that passed out during Woman King I hope everything is ok at the Stonecrest theater in Charlotte.,9,0,1
63,63,Terrifier 2,6.2,Horror,11-Oct-22,Art is a new horror icon,"With practically double the runtime of the original film, Damien Leone's ""Terrifier 2"" sets out to be a more lengthy, ambitious, and terrifying movie than ""Terrifier,"" the film that started it all through the memorable introduction of a new horror icon in Art The Clown. And while the first movie wasn't the most creative, with a light on story and high on violence approach that never differentiated itself any further from your ordinary uber-gory slasher, the character of Art managed to capture the attention and imagination of viewers and critics alike. The silent, but incredibly animated and expressive, mime proved to be a beloved villain through the juxtaposition of his quiet demeanor but loud actions - as they put so succinctly in this film, ""For a guy who doesn't speak, he sure makes a lot of noise."" Art's shenanigans continue in full force here, giving audiences more of what they expect, but maybe not exactly in the way they expected - ""Terrifier 2"" improves upon its predecessor through its more complex plot, especially as told through its character development of Lauren LaVera's character, Sienna.

A two hour and 18 minute run time is nothing to sneeze at, and director Damien Leone knows this - so he wastes no time in introducing the carnage that audiences expect from Art. Opening with a bloody bang, the film engages immediately, giving viewers just a taste of the madness that is to come. But where the first ""Terrifier"" keeps its momentum through a cat and mouse style rampage that features Art mutilating and murdering everyone in his path, ""Terrifier 2"" slows things down after its explosive start. With an actual plot this time around, contrasting against the original's more proof of concept style, ""Terrifier 2"" takes its time to build plot development through elongated dream sequences and true to life conversations, especially when it comes to the character of Sienna.

""Terrifier 2's"" final girl, Sienna finds herself face to face with evil itself in the form of a psychotic clown. And you'd think that a basically all good, morally upright character would be a distraction from the film, but her good nature personality actually enhances the goings on, as she is a lawful good protagonist to contrast against Art's chaotic evil. Lauren LaVera was incredible in the role as a fierce heroine who can certainly stand her own against a formidable opponent - I can see her compared to characters such as Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode, and her showdown with Art was endlessly entertaining and narratively satisfying. But alas! If you're watching ""Terrifier 2,"" you're watching it for the over the top violence and gore - so let's talk about it.

When it comes to slasher film blood and guts, ""Terrifier 2"" is the real deal - I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this violent in theatres. Art rips people's eyes out, chops people's heads off, flays people alive, and scalps people, just to name a few things; if you are at all squeamish, you should not see this movie. However, if you enjoyed the first one for all of its darkly comedic brutality, you will certainly enjoy the upped ante here. All of the violence is disgusting and hard to watch, but it's all being done by a highly animated and over-exaggerated clown, which makes even the most horrific crimes bizarrely entertaining. You'll find yourself having a sort of sick smile on your face as Art makes his mark, and while you might feel yourself feeling guilty, you can't help but think that the movie is relishing in its carnage as much as you are.

""Terrifier 2"" is a fun movie - it's by no means high art, and I don't think it is a classic by any means, but Art is certainly a horror icon and watching him in action literally never gets old. While more ambitious than the original, the plot still lacks real narrative heft besides, ""There's an evil clown, and someone has to stop him."" That said, the simplicity really does give way to some incredible horror set pieces that I will have burned into my memory for a long time. If you're a fan of the first film, or even if you're not and you are simply a fan of horror, you have to give this one a watch.",7,1,1

They should be forced to submit a letter of apology to Tom Savini for years of butchering his FX work.

My son liked it but he's 17, yes it was his turn to pick. I think about 200k of the 250k budget was spent on fake blood and the cleanup of said fake blood, if I have to say a positive the gore effect work was decent to good.

This movie didn't look cheap, when i see decoration and lighting and even camera work.. not cheap at all. But it felt as cheap and trashy as most of the gory 70s and 80s movies, even more than them... If you loved the 1st movie, you will love this one too.

David Howard Thornton, phenomenal here. Please don't let it be too long before we get another movie, I know Covid held this one up, I only hope another is in the pipeline.

As well as all of this they have a female lead that is acted well, written well, and delivers enough punch to make the audience root for her. Really well done guys. Good Job with this one.

I'd watched Halloween Kills a few days ago, what an utter disappointment that was, this perked me up a little because it showed that creators are still out there that are willing to give the audience what they want. This is certainly a little more supernatural than the previous rendition, but that's fine by me as it's carried off with just enough cheese to make it what it should be.

Besides this, nothing at all, bad directing and I don't even speak of the acting.

So, it won't be a surprise if I say it is not for the sissies, it is bloody, with man details concerning meat chopper fight sequences. But the story is not that bad for such a film, not that bad.

But this movie turned out to be pretty good actually. Yes, this movie got a serious audio and soundtrack problems. The dialog between or among the characters sometimes was too low or too vague to be heard clearly, and most of the time was blocked by the annoying loud soundtrack which supposedly should be in the background and subtle enough to support the ongoing of the story, but sadly, the music often played too loud and over-the-top dominant over the scenes, and lot of times too religiously annoying. It also made me wonder if the production team hired a qualified enough audio professional group to handle the recording or microphone. It seems that there were lot of times, the microphone was placed either too far away or too high to record the characters dialog so that always ended up either too vague or too low to be heard clearly. The crew who took care of the audio part of this movie should never be hired by any other movie makers in case to cause the similar problems.

There are so many negative reviews against this movie, but to me, it's a decent and seriously made one, at least worth watching once for your time and money. Ben Foster did a very good job, but the screenplay didn't give him too much to develop and show the character he played. Michael Caine also faithfully did his part, even it's such a weightless role. Sophie Lowe also acted well for her tragic role in this movie, but luckily, her character was much well developed as the storyline went on.

78,78,Medieval,5.9,Action Drama History,11-Sep-22,Convoluted and mostly bland,"Medieval is helped by a restrained yet captivating performance from Ben Foster. Even better is the production design and costumes; it's a very good-looking, immersive, realistic production.

It's a film that has some impressive moments of intense action and several compelling scenes. But the film can't help but crumble under the weight of its convoluted storytelling.

The plot revolves around a soldier caught in the midst of the political scheming between two brothers who seek to be emperor, and how he and those he leads are forced to suffer the consequences of their scheming.

When I put it that way, it sounds simple; but that's not how it plays out on screen.

The films does a lamentably poor job of establishing its multiple antagonists and their respective loyalties, motivations, and especially how they seek to achieve their goals.

This is largely due in part to an absurd amount of name-dropping that gets difficult to follow. There are certain characters whose names are crucial to the plot but these characters themselves are rarely, and sometimes never, seen.

It's unclear what role everyone is playing in the story because there are so many people to keep track of and the script doesn't properly develop any of them.

Not even the action is particularly exciting. It's mostly clumsily filmed and opaquely edited, leaving the impact of every sword swing and arrow pierce off screen. It's action without weight or a sense of significance.

By the end of the movie, I felt nothing, because the story concludes without anything of note having changed for either the characters or for the political situation we've been following.

It's a largely dull experience without clear stakes and without clear goals and without any meaningful depth of character or theme.

Straight from the start it reminded me of History's Vikings tv series, if you're a fan of that you might love this as well. I didn't know it's a true story. There wasn't as much character development but I think they didn't have time for that, it focuses more on the story and that was enough to get you invested in the characters by the end. The acting was splendid by the whole cast. A little sad because I have a feeling the movie won't get the recognition it deserves. I think it's better than The Northman in the sense it's paced better and has more story in my opinion, cinematography might not be as great but still pretty good. The fights were amazing and bloody but I thought some gory scenes weren't shown to us, we just get to see the aftermath especially in the first half. There was a lot at stake and I love how you never really know who's gonna make it especially in the third act.

This is a true story, based on real events and real people. We have the historical data on all of them yet in the movie, they are vaguely mentioned in intro and outro credits.

The in between or the movie itself is a random series of fights between groups that are not developed well; we feel no emphathy for them, nor do we even know who they are. The movie is also not historically accurate in terms of setting, mannerism, props. It is just generic medieval fighting movie with a backstory that the viewer has to create in their mind as they watch. If you do that, it becomes better sure, but on its own, as a movie as presented, it lacks a lot.

The events this attempts to cover are pivotal for the time and could have easily been on the level of development we saw in braveheart and gladiator; but alas they opted for shallowness. Acting is not great, not bad but not great, acceptable at best. If it were not based on the true events it attempts to cover, it would have stood better for what it was. Unfortunately the creators trying to make it real life historical completely bombed the pooch here. There was no need for it because there is no history in this movie; none, at all. I guess they felt it added extra importance to the movie by telling us who it was about and what events it tried to convey but that's about it. Few lines on the screen that do not match what we saw, do not a historical movie make.

It is watchable, just highly disappointing, having ruined such an amazing potential story. I understand it is difficult to properly convey things so far back in history where records were so vague about a lot of things, however look at how other movies approached it. This simply does not even feel in the right time period. It feels a lot like generic sword fight at your local fair ground.

If the dialogue isn't being drowned out by the unnecessary loud and booming bass, the spoken words are just unintelligible.

Medieval isn't 'Gladiator' and doesn't try to be.

The movie does well with slightly over 2 hours but could easily have been made into a miniseries or multi-part movie(only a small pivotal point of his life is conveyed in the movie). Some may disagree but as a fan of History this is a story that needed to be told, and told in its graphic realism.

This is a superior piece of action entertainment that should get anyone's heart pumping and engaged with the fate of the characters. There are some really awesome actors on display here - I especially liked Ben Foster and Matthew Goode.

I was surprised by the choice to tell a story from very early in Zizka's career, but I am glad that there were at least some references to the Hussite Rebels (one of the earliest attempts to reform the Church), and there is an awesome postscript scene showing the start of the Battle of Grunewald - one of Zizka's greatest victories that broke the Teutonic Order.",9,1,1

It's a small movie, but the production is good enough to deliver the look & feel of medieval time. The story is simple, the time takes place in the early days of the hero, when he was just a low level knight.

Action is good, but don't expect a high budget film with huge battles, this is mainly dramatic movie, and you will surely enjoy the small part played by Michael Caine.

Everyone is filthy, the violence is disturbing, and all of the little details that you look for in a film set during this period are there.

It's a pleasure obviously to see Ben Foster and Michael Caine on the same screen, though it would've been great to have them interact more. But they, and the rest of the cast, are first class.

There are a lot of fights, but two of the battle scenes just stand out as being fantastically well done and gripping. Bravura directing.

Many times, it just looks like some farmer is mowing hay. Another big issue are those almost constant drones and sounds in the background which a) make the voices sometimes almost inaudible and b) do not fit well into the given scenario or timeline. There are many scenes there is no need for music or background noise, but, well, somehow they still squeezed some in - maybe those responsible for the score are paid for every note played, who knows...

I would have scored this a full 10/10 otherwise.

Bad audio is something I have found to be highly prevalent in a great many of the film releases of 2022. Either the actors are mumbling in low inaudible tones or, incidental film music scores are far too loud and therefore drown out the dialogue so its unable to be heard properly. Worst year ever for sound departments everywhere!

Its a lavish 2 hour film with a good cast (playing their roles brilliantly) and fabulous action scenes; the latter being very, very violent in content (but back in the medieval 1400's it was violently vicious).

However sometimes low budget movies can be good so I persevered. Unfortunately despite having a semi respectable cast the writers are all over the place. The plot is a confused mess, from priests and noble ladies talking communism to warlords quoting The Art of War the dialogue is anachronistic. The action scenes are poorly filmed and choreographed.

Jákl is Czech and if it wasn't for him, this movie would be way worse (or wouldn't exist in the first place). Still, he made it with American audience in mind and it's an American movie, with all the advantages and drawbacks that brings. Remember Mel Gibson's Braveheart? Then you've got an idea. However, unlike Braveheart, Jan Zizka (Medieval) feels a little bit more respectful - after all, this is his own history (while Gibson has no relationship to Scottish history).

Could this movie have been better? Definitely. Americans have proven that they can make and appreciate historically accurate films (e.g. Gettysburg). It should be noted though that we know very little about Zizka's actions in this part of his life so it's basically an ""origin story"" which can't be disproved but we can with absolute confidence say that the depicted events are highly improbable.

Expecting a brilliant show is not what I got. Starring some well-known actors, but most others completely unknown to me, did not help. The spoken English by non English speaking actors was difficult to understand what they were saying and the story was most confusing. It concerns a numbers of bands of badies and goodies running around in the forest bashing each other whenever they met, but the viewer has no idea who is who. The impression I got was the film being a symbolic presentation of what had been endured in this century with gospel type of music throughout the show. Apparently the movie makes sense if you know this history.",3,-1,-1
96,96,Medieval,5.9,Action Drama History,10-Sep-22,Medieval? More like mediocre.,"""Medieval"" is a feature film, perhaps playing on a silver screen near you. That said, if you decide to see this movie in theatres, you may find yourself perplexed when you begin to realize that ""Medieval"" moreso belongs at the bottom of the nearest bargain bin at your local Walmart. And at the time of this writing, there are four somewhat positive reviews of this movie posted, and it stuns me to see that all of them have rated this movie a 7 or above because, in all of the infinite multiverse, there is no reality where ""Medieval"" should garner a score of that caliber.

Wow. I wasn't intoxicated when I watched this movie, but upon walking out of the theatre I found myself unsteady, wobbling from side to side, my head spinning in utter disbelief of what I have just witnessed. It is shocking to me that a team of so-called film professionals not only watched this movie and gave it their go ahead but also deemed it adequate enough to be released to the public at a cinema near you. ""Medieval"" contains many flaws that drag this film down into the dirt form which it came, with its cardinal sin being that it is, simply, boring beyond belief.

You could go to the park, dig up a patch of grass, plant a seed, spit in the dirt in a futile attempt to water it, throw some soil back on it, and then sit down and stare at the ground for three hours, waiting for your seed to sprout; I guarantee you that that activity would be infinitely more exciting than anything ""Medieval"" has to offer. Rated R for strong and violent grisly content, you'd expect plenty of slick, professionally helmed action set pieces to drive the plot forward. Instead, you get three or four poorly filmed action sequences that are in between long stretches of horrendously uninteresting and borderline incomprehensible dialogue - but we'll get back to that. The action is not well shot; all of it is filmed too close, and too shaky, to be clearly seen and enjoyed. You'll see a shot of someone swinging a weapon, and then a cut to someone getting hit, or falling over - rinse and repeat for every single scene of action in this movie. Instead of taking the time to plan for professional choreography, it looks like the filmmakers went to the Olivier Megaton school of directing, deciding to stick the camera as close to the actors as possible and shake it as much as they can in an attempt to trick the audience into thinking they are viewing something exciting. This lame attempt certainly did not work on me.

But perhaps the plot is interesting enough to hold one's attention? If you think this is the case, you'd be sorely mistaken! This movie's plot is barely understandable, filled with badly written dialogue, performed by actors whose lines are, half of the time, obviously dubbed over, thus cheapening the viewing experience. A word to the filmmakers: When I'm watching Michael Caine talk and the audio that is coming out of the speakers isn't in sync with the way his lips are moving, and you expect me not to notice or not to care, I feel as if you don't have respect for me as a viewer, so why should I then respect your movie?

Ben Foster is fine here - I am a fan of his, but he really had nothing to work with, especially when it comes to the scatterbrained romance this movie introduces, and then promptly drops. At the least, you can't say this was a cheap looking film, as the production value was there; other than that, ""Medieval"" fails in literally every other aspect. Unless you are an insomniac who desperately wants to fall asleep, no one should waste their time in seeing this slog.",2,-1,-1
97,97,Medieval,5.9,Action Drama History,18-Nov-22,ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???,"Jan Zizka was one of the great military commanders that history has ever known. He defeated the armoured knights of the Holy Roman Empire with a handful of peasants armed with flails and pitchforks. His armoured wagons (or ""wagonburgs"") laid the foundations for what we now call ""the tank"". He was a legend, freeing the Czech people from the tyrannical popery of Rome. However, he was also a deeply complex individual- the original ""amazing grace"" story. Hacking out a living as a highwayman/mercenary, Zizka's eyes were opened by the gospel of Jan Hus, who taught him how to ""fight the good fight of faith"" before he was tragically martyred. Today, he is perceived as an enduring symbol of Czech nationalism (I nation of which I am fortunate enough to be a member) and his passionate devotion God is overlooked. MEDIEVAL does nothing to mend this one-sided view, with its gratuitous violence, poor dialogue and derivative plot. Zizka become just another gruff-voiced tough guy, unwisely blending his Russel Crowe antics with half-hearted attempts at religious motivation. Director Petr Jakl chose to make a film about Zizka's youth and that's perfectly fine, but Zizka only came to the Lord when he was an old man and had already made most of his mistakes. Forcing the Christian message into this picture feels... awkward. Showing a young man who did terrible things to survive until he was shown a better way (""amazing grace that saved a wretch like me"") would've surely made a far more powerful and profound story. Instead, Foster (who, though a fine actor, is woefully miscast and woefully misused, trying to deliver a Braveheart performance when kitted out with a Ninja Turtles script) ends up stumbling his way through a GOT version of the Robin Hood myth. This was supposed to be the most expensive film that Czech has ever made but the battle scenes felt surprisingly cheap and disappointingly small-scale, especially considering the fact that during his youth, Zizka allegedly took part (and lost his eye in) the Battle of Grunwald- one of the biggest and bloodiest battles in medieval history. Seeing his mighty wagonburgs and hearing choruses of ""Ye Who are Warriors of God"" (the Hussite battle hymn that struck terror into the hearts of Emperor Sigismund's mercenary crusaders) were pleasant diversions from this hackneyed, melodramatic mess.

The story of Jan Zizka is a story of faith moving mountains and of a wolf becoming a sheep. As this movie's dedication reads, it is also story about people fighting for their freedom. So, it is sad to see such an inspiring story go the way of the straight-to-DVD release but who knows? With a more native cast (Ondrej Vetchy, one of our most beloved actors makes an appearance amounting to that of a cameo... when I think he could've been and should've been the best Zizka) and a new director (I'm thinking... Mel Gibson, perhaps?), the legend of Jan Zizka may make a glorious return to the screen someday. For now, I just hope Jakl doesn't try to defile his legacy any further.",5,-1,0

It is such a bland, jumpy, not at all epic, with numerous outbursts of explicit violence, which, however, do not save anything. The camera is always in motion during the battles, but the transitions from wholes to details are confusing, choppy, and the viewer sometimes has no idea who is cutting whose body. However, Jákl deserves admiration in terms of production efficiency - even though it is the most expensive Czech film, it is still small compared to Hollywood. The Middle Ages is here as a solidly convincing muddy abomination of history, but the characters are more like running through autumn-colored forests. But above all, the story runs strangely: the power games for the throne are clumsy, opponents exchange prisoners, bands of mercenaries move strangely. It doesn't even look like the $20 million, it's just a bunch of people running around in the woods playing out confusing action scenes. Jákl just describes all the clichés he's ever seen.

I won't delve too much into the story as I think going in knowing as little as possible will very much elevate the experience. What I will say is that it is a very predictable but very enjoyable story. When they let rip and ramp up the humour and the action it's a blast.

The performances are all pretty solid. Nothing stand out but they work.

In terms of horror, it isn't particularly scary. I do think that there was potential to make this much scarier and give it more impact, so there is definitely a missed opportunity there.

Maeve (Niamh Cusack) has looked after it and warns them of the need to leave out a blood offering for the Redcaps (Goblins definitely not Leprechauns), liver will do. The house needs some repairs and the duo make the mistake of employing local builders the Whelans who turn out to be a violent criminal family. Then things turn unwelcome. There are elements of humour in this film, even some good natured paddy whackery but it is generally dark in tone. When a local drunk sings a song mocking the fairies he is killed by the Redcaps.

They come to the rescue of Maya when she is attacked but when called upon again for help there is a price to be paid. Some very violent scenes as the Redcaps stab, cut throats and dine on their victims., they even deliver a severed head in a plastic bag, like a faithful cat bringing home a mouse as a present. Equally upsetting is the violence of Daddy Whelan (Colm Meanry) towards his simple son Eoin and the violence of the Whelans as a whole towards Jamie and Maya during a siege of the house. Dark misty woods, the creepy muttering Redcaps and a stone structure amid the trees add to the eeriness.

A standard horror would have the Redcaps attacking the couple in their isolated home. That's what this movie seems to be setting up initially. It would be a more satisfying horror. This plot takes a detour away from that. It makes the horror less compelling. The big action section just doesn't have the same intensity. I do like the couple although Jamie can be a bit much.

There are some interesting shots - some Dutch angles and POV are cool - but this feel stupidly long for a film that is just 2 hours long. It's like watching the action going from setpiece to setpiece in a very inorganic way while travelling between boring universe with a lot of cringe dialogue. I don't even get the point of all this story for the entire universe and even the score - surprisingly considering that is Elfman - is super generic.

I loved the first Strange movie, it's my second favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier. So this was extra disappointing.

Firstly, you're not going to have any idea what's going on with the main antagonist unless you watched the Disney+ show Wandavision. Even though I did watch it, it had been months, and I didn't remember all the details, so her whole backstory fell flat. This movie was less about Strange and more about her.

There's also a subplot involving Strange's old flame, but since we only saw them as exes in the previous film, it Didn't really feel that impactful.

There's also an obligatory teen sidekick, which I guess is now standard in the Phase IV fully Disneyized MCU. She might have been interesting, but she's just there as a macguffiin and has no real personality.

There's also random cameos from other Marvel properties, I'm beginning to see these bits of crossover fan service are the sole purpose of having a multiverse.

Seriously, I don't know why I keep giving my money to this franchise. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi and now Dr Strange 2, have all been dull, uninspired CGI crap fests, that rely entirely on cameos and fan service to keep people coming back.

133,133,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,6.9,Action Adventure Fantasy,06-May-22,Multiverse of... Something-ness,"Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).

Doctor Strange 2 covers its concept of multiverses instead of telling a re-inventive character-driven story like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. Doctor Strange 2's got splashes of self-aware humour here and there, but it's gonna have to take some magic to become a film comparable to the MCU's stronger entries.

The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff IS there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.

Doctor Strange 2 is definitely a noble attempt at something 'new' for the MCU, and it's sure as hell more confident than Eternals, but it suffers the same character-squandering issues as it.

With a universe as vast as Marvel's, not every entry in the MCU was guaranteed to work. At least it tried.",5,-1,0

142,142,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,6.9,Action Adventure Fantasy,05-May-22,Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed,"So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.

And you might say, ""well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie"", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.

First of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!

About the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought ""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't ""feel"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.

And it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.

It would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.

For people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!

Danny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.

The visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.

But the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.

And as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.

I also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.

I don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.

And America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.

Some reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.

We also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!

I also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and ""their"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using ""they"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)

In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.

Maybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.

Update: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here.",6,1,0

146,146,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,6.9,Action Adventure Fantasy,08-May-22,A Puzzle No One Cares To Solve,"Oh director Sam Raimi is up to his ""Army Of Darkness"" ways. What with the cameos from Bruce Campbell, a spell book, slapstick snap zooms at canted angles and the Pontiac Delta 88 hovering in a muddled universe. This is a very sloppy slapping together of an intricate storyline of wish fulfillment...if only the bad gal wasn't so into being...a mother? Yeah, that is at the core of the conflict. Wanda the Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) wants the life of domestication versus being shunned as a witch in her own world. Therefore, she must harness the power of a teenager who has this gift.

Okay.

Unfortunately, what she also has IS the power to live the other woman's life (it's really her, if you think about it) in small doses. And only if she uses some spell book. Who knows. The entire thing is this dense. Meanwhile, Doc Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is lamenting about his own life. Losing Christine (Rachel McAdams) to a different suitor because it would be safer for her. Such is the life of comic book heroes. A tired trope actually. So he is saddled with that question...in any other universe, would he end up with the love of his life. I shrug here, because all of this is really inconsequential since it never is addressed in the movie anyway. And they have the chemistry of a brother and sister. So I don't get her appeal.

Yeah, I think this is an above average flick. Only because I do miss the old Raimi style. This brought back those memories. Other than that, I found myself dozing at parts. The special effects, while really well done, are oftentimes nauseating. Anyone with vertigo should be warned. And, well, it seemed very empty when all was said and done.

To me, the multiverse is a fascinating question. One that was wonderfully realized in ""Everything, Everywhere And All At Once"" Here it seems to be a non-issue. And it aggravated me that in every universe they visit, it seems this crew don't address the chaos and mayhem they inflict on the people of the city. I mean, some of the damage to property should closed the city down. In this film, you see teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) eat a torta a scene later. Ugh.

The biggest nagging thought is how unnecessary this installment was. Why? Why was this made? Made no sense in the grander future schemes. Perhaps Marvel nerds can answer this.

It is also much more adult. Which was a pleasant surprise. I can tell that the kids who went to see this got very lost. Their silence said it all. And for that, I am grateful.",6,0,0

It almost feels you are watching a Wanda film rather than a Dr. Strange film. This was a huge negative as he leaves barely any impact. Majority of the impact is left by Wanda only who puts up a near Civil war like situation with Strange.

This is a VFX heavy film. Lots and lots and lots of special effects like any other Marvel film but here, to mask the poor story has been used. It is only this that make the film enjoyable. Often certain fight sequences also make the film enjoyable. Humor also works wherever present.

Wanda and Dr. Strange are both very unique and gray characters which makes them fun. The actors also do a great job portraying their characters.

Marvel has never been this dark before. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't got a higher age limit. But it's great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.

The multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.

Like the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn't take the viewer out of the movie.

The problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There's a lot of plot armor, but it's almost impossible to avoid when you're playing with these powerful heroes. The magic can be a bit convoluted at times, but just remind yourself that it's a movie. Don't try poke holes at every plothole or stupid decision. Just have fun because it's a fun movie.",7,1,1
150,150,Violent Night,6.7,Action Comedy Crime,30-Dec-22,This Santa Dies Hard,"Possibly the most tedious film question ever asked is, ""is Die Hard a Christmas movie?"" Violent Night says ""what if Die Hard WAS a Christmas movie?""

Its an excellent mix of two genres. First and foremost it's a (very violent) man in a tight spot action movie but hidden beneath is a traditional Christmas story of people becoming believers and a jaded main character getting their feative mojo back.

The film success is largely down to David Harbour's fantastic turn as a disillusioned St Nick. His ability to project charisma even when appearing tired and fed up carries the day, or in this case, night. He also cleverly avoids the trap of playing Santa too dark, for all his boozing and necessary killing he is still recognisably Father Christmas. The rest of the cast are all decent as well, with John Leguiziamo making a fun villian. Even the child character manages to not be annoying, although some of her dialogue hints that they had originally wanted a younger actress than Leah Brady.

The other big plus Violent Night has is its, well violence. The set pieces go above and beyond, with villians being impaled, burned and dismembered. Highlights include a Home Alone inspired sequence (turns out the invaders in this film are a lot less durable than Harry and Marv) and a Mortal Kombat worthy finish to the final showdown. There's also a decent vain of comedy even if you won't exactly be guffawing in the aisles.

There are a couple of things that take you out of proceedings, like the bad guys refusal to just shoot their guns and some very generic family interactions, but overall Violent Night is a very fun couple of hours.

I'm not sure it's deserving of cult status, but don't ask me why, I have a feeling that in years to come, this may well develop something of a following.

The clue is in the title, Violent Night, and boy this film doesn't hold back, in terms of violence and manner of deaths, this film packs a real punch, you will see all sorts, people dismembered, shot, impaled, it really doesn't hold back.

If Santa did actually pop down for a visit, I can imagine him being this disillusioned, this irritated, with a genuinely low opinion of people, this is where the film scores in my opinion, the performance of David Harbour, who is genuinely very good.

Acting was good. David Harbor was great again. I liked the movie overall, except for a few cringe scenes. The action scenes weren't bad either. It was a funny movie.

When Violent Night is good, it's really good. It isn't always nearly as entertaining as it could be, but it definitely capitalises on its goofy premise in all the right ways at various points.

The violence is blunt and rudimentary, but there's something strikingly effective about it. Each hit is loud and visceral, and many of the actual deaths are a lot more creative than I was expecting them to be, even if the violence leads me up to each death is pretty by-the-numbers.

I was pleasantly surprised with the small but satisfying character arcs that the script weaves into the simple story. Santa is given a cynical outlook on humanity and himself to overcome, the family has tension to work out, and the mythology of Santa's backstory is actually given a twist to make his capacity for violence make sense in this movie.

There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about any of this, but it's all crafted with care and it's investing enough that I could easily see myself watching this in subsequent years.

157,157,Violent Night,6.7,Action Comedy Crime,02-Dec-22,Definetely how I like to start the season.,"As far as Christmas movies go, is this better than Die Hard? Of course not! However, it's no doubt a Christmas movie. David Harbor plays a Santa Claus who lost his Christmas spirit and gets it back by going total medieval on a gang of kidnappers looking to take a small fortune from the type of rich folks you hate the most over the Holiday season. Harbor's Santa reminds me a lot of his version of Hellboy, I think when it comes down to it both pictures are Metal as Hell, and it's like Mr. Stranger Things just doing vocals for both albums. Mr. John Leguizamo is in the flick as the naughtiest of naughty men (not as naughty as Hans Gruber, but who can be). Like a sick guitar riff Leguizamo brings his season experience as an actor to create an interesting and funny bad guy. Leaning towards the Home Alone factor, this movie is as violent as the title suggests, which is rare, really. The little kid in turns out to be worse than Kevin McCallister when it comes to projecting her home from criminal masterminds. It's like someone read the minds of every person that watches Die Hard on Christmas day and just wanted to give us something official. I appreciate that.",7,1,1

Well, the presence of the writers behind the SONIC THE HEDGEHOG films (!) is the sticking point here, because VIOLENT NIGHT struggles with a puerile script and a tone that bounces back and forth between gory black humour and saccharine schmaltz presented unironically.

The fight scenes are mediocre, shot in close ups, often in the dark. Only the final fight, between the Santa and the Leguizamo character, got me excited. The tone of the movie is very uneven, it jumps between irreverent brutality mixed with gross cussing and the overly sweet, syrupy moments of family-friendly melodrama. It's like a weird mixture of a Tarantino movie and a Hallmark Christmas one. Apart from the Santa and the little girl all other characters are lazily written, even Leguizamo is a bit bland.

The action scenes are really good with clear camera work and good choreography. The only problem is the scarcity. I believe there are two action scenes before the climax. I wanted more.

I was really surprised at how often they seemed to shy away from showing the violence in a move with the word ""violent"" in the title. Now there is definitely a bunch of violence and gore. But there are numerous times where they use strategies seen in PG-13 movies, like cutting away or having the scene darkly lit. They shortchanged the gore fans.

And while I thought there were some good heartfelt moments, it became mushy and cheesy more than once.

I mostly enjoyed this movie, but I can't help but feel disappointed at how close it came to being awesome. (1 viewing, opening Thursday SuperScreen 12/1/2022)",5,0,0
165,165,Violent Night,6.7,Action Comedy Crime,02-Dec-22,Bloody Funny,"There is truth in advertising: ""Violent Night"" is set on Christmas and it's gore-in-Santa's-beard brutal. That is the one shred of honesty in a terminally cynical movie that tries to pass off lamebrained sadism as edgy comedy. Please - there is not enough edge here to cut through a fruitcake. David Harbour, cruising on his ""Stranger Things"" fame, portrays a Santa Claus in the grip of existential malaise: He's been doing the gig for centuries and for what? Nothing can please those modern consumerist, ungrateful brats. In between deliveries he drowns his despair in booze. Santa's schedule eventually brings him to the estate of the ultrawealthy Lightstone clan. The matriarch, Gertrude (Beverly D'Angelo), rules over her company and her family with an iron fist and a potty mouth. That last is because everybody in Hollywood knows that nothing is funnier than a swearing grandma, with the exception of a swearing kid. Enter 7-year-old Trudy (Leah Brady), Gertrude's granddaughter, who is happy to oblige. Tellingly all of the movie's would-be meme-able lines are unprintable in this newspaper. Adding insult to bodily injury, the director, Tommy Wirkola (""The Trip,"" ""Dead Snow""), and the screenwriters, Pat Casey and Josh Miller, can't even muster any decent set pieces. Instead, the movie unfurls as a tedious series of bloody deaths and witless dialogue. Speaking of wasting one's time: Why cast the excellent Edi Patterson (""The Righteous Gemstones"") as Gertrude's calculating daughter if you're not going to give her anything remotely fun to do? ""Violent Night,"" trying to have its gingerbread and eat it too, also panders to the Yuletide spirit with Santa learning the meaning of Christmas again and a subplot about Trudy wishing for her estranged parents (Alex Hassell and Alexis Louder) to reconcile. It doesn't help. In the gleefully crass comedy ""Violent Night,"" Santa is real, but also really naughty. He cusses, drinks to excess and relieves himself off the side of his flying sleigh. He thinks kids are greedy, Christmas is tarnished and life lacks meaning-until a house in Greenwich, Conn., to which he is delivering presents gets invaded by robbers seeking to crack a vault while holding a wealthy family hostage. Then Santa becomes John McClane. ""Violent Night"" might as well be called ""John McClaus."" As Santa stomps and cuts and maims his way through the Lightstone mansion, with a giddy Trudy going full ""Home Alone"" to support him, ""Violent Night"" is often quite entertaining. (Wait for the moment Wirkola unveils a truly demented spin on ""The Nutcracker""; you'll never look at that ballet the same way.) But even as Wirkola and company ratchet up the violence and find still more clever ways to off the naughtiest of the naughty, a hefty sack of subplots, personal motivations, and nefarious double-crossings bog down what could have been the season's most bloody good time (emphasis on the bloody).",10,0,1

169,169,Violent Night,6.7,Action Comedy Crime,05-Dec-22,A new tradition was born,"There's such a true point this film makes which not surprisingly gets lost amongst the internet generation, the greed, entitlement and arrogance people show now has killed traditions and long time fables quicker than at any point, people are so weak now they couldn't accept not getting all the gratitude for presents anyway.

I've always been a believer in Christmas , I know for some it's the worst time of year and for those I'm sorry, but there's still something magical about what Christmas does to people. I think Christmas films stay with you longer than any other type, from home alone to modern ones like klaus there are films you watch every year that bring you joy, I have a section of horrors and this slots perfectly into that, they're maybe more of an every other year kinda deal.

There are a few flaws it's like outside the child and Santa all the budget had gone and these actors felt like those awful tv movie ones you know shouldn't be in the big time, the mom of the girl is fine but the rest, not so much, the only other thing was the order at the end should've been the satisfaction after the event not before as that moment felt forced at that point whereas 10 minutes later it'd have made more sense.

The villains were far better, the Scandinavian and the girl doing the home alone stuff was brilliant, normally comes across as cheap and cliche but they did this so well, I like how they didn't try to use logic or make things up, Santa not getting how it worked just felt so much more natural. Whilst I'd have loved more of the home alone style stuff I thought the fight scenes were fresh and creative and really well done.

I feel with tweaks this could be a new bad Santa trilogy maybe? Could prequel how his joy got run down over the years and tie in things he did as Xmas wishes that were potentially violent? Just ideas but I'd gladly see a return.

I wasn't sure how to feel when I saw the trailer, in my gut I thought it'd be a straight to dvd film that conned me at the cinema, but it isn't. I'm struggling to remember that last really good Xmas film at the cinema, I had a whole imax to myself and watched this and it was joyful!",9,1,1
170,170,Violent Night,6.7,Action Comedy Crime,22-Dec-22,"Violent, Funny, but still very much in touch with Holiday magic and cheer, violent night is deviously entertaining and features a great performance from David Harbour","Disillusioned with the increasingly material nature of Christmas, Santa Claus (David Harbour) has taken to drinking and considers abandoning his role after tonight. Meanwhile in Connecticut, Jason Lightstone (Alex Hassell) and his estranged wife Linda (Alexis Louder) along with their daughter Gertrude ""Trudy"" (Leah Brady) get together to spend Christmas at Jason's mother, Getrude's (Beverly D'Angelo), home which will also be attended by Jason's gold-digging sister Alva (Edi Patterson), Alva's influencer son Bertrude ""Bert"" (Alexander Elliot), and her wannabe action star boyfriend Morgan Steel (Cam Gigandet). Trudy still believing in Santa Claus only wishes for her parents to be back together and prepares homemade cookies for Santa. Upon arrival to the Lightstone estate, Santa tastes the cookies loving that they are homemade as opposed to store bought and falls asleep having raided the Lightstone liquor cabinet. However, when a team of mercenaries lead by Jimmy ""Mr. Scrooge"" Martinez (John Leguizamo) storm the mansion and take the Lightstone family hostage intending to steal $300 million from a vault under the house, Santa must rescue Trudy and her family.

Violent Night is the latest action spectacle from John Wick producers 87North Productions and their third film overall this year after Day Shift and Bullet Train. Universal acquired the original pitch from Sonic the Hedgehog screenwriters Pat Casey and Josh Miller with the intention of having 87North produce it. David Harbour and Tommy Wirkola were soon attached shortly thereafter with filming taking place in Winnipeg from January through March of this year. Upon release the film received mostly positive reviews from critics and while the film opened in second place behind Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Violent Night was meant to be a hard edged piece of Holiday counterprogramming comparable to Universal's 2015 horror comedy Krampus with Violent Night's numbers being slightly above Krampus and ultimately becoming a success. Violent Night features many of the staples that action afficionados have become attuned to from other 87North productions, but with an enjoyable take that mixes twisted humor, hard knuckle action, and a surprising amount of sincerity for Christmas and the Holiday season Violent Night's probably my favorite 87North film since at least Nobody.

David Harbour's take on Santa Claus has been very much front and center in the marketing for this movie, and deservedly so as he creates a memorably untraditional take on the Christmas icon that near matches Billy Bob Thorton's character from Bad Santa in terms of matching the drunkenness and burnt out cynicism with an opening scene at a bar in Bristol, England setting the stage for his character arc and also being very funny. The movie also features a great collection of characters with the Lightstone family with Alex Hassell and Alexis Louder very strong as estranged husband and wife Jason and Linda, and we also have some very funny jerks populating the family with Beverly D'Angelo having fun playing the casually foul mouth matriarch of the family or Edi Patterson, Cam Gigandet, and Alexander Elliot playing more opportunistic family members. But making her debut is Leah Brady as Trudy and she is absolutely fantastic playing an innocent child character, but also gives the character just enough of an edge to make her more than a construct such as her scenes talking to Santa via walkie or setting up Home Alone style booby traps that aren't restrained by a PG rating.

The movie also gives us some memorable villains with the always welcome John Leguizamo playing up the menace with the aptly codenamed Mr. Scrooge who although his primary goal is the $300 million underneath the house makes no secret of his hatred and disdain for Christmas while also being very funny. Brendan Feltcher also gives us some memorable scenes as Scrooge's unhinged henchman ""Krampus"" including something involving a giant nutcracker that had me laughing to a point of near suffocation. Despite the humor present in the film however, the movie is actually a Christmas film spiritually as well as in its usage of iconography with several moments played for sincerity in their discussion of the Holiday season and the scenes David Harbour shares with Lead Brady do a nice job of aiming for the heart. But also aiming for the heart (and the eyes and everything else vulnerable) are the action scenes which are once again nicely choregraphed and brutally entertaining.

Violent Night gives you exactly what you want from an darkly comic action take on Santa and features solid filmmaking, writing, and acting to pull it off. David Harbour has created a memorable take on Santa that I'd love to see more of (and they certainly leave the door open for that) and if you love your Christmas tales dark, bloody, twisted, and funny then rejoice because you've found another one.",9,1,1
171,171,Violent Night,6.7,Action Comedy Crime,02-Jan-23,Refreshing,"Feels very much like Agatha Christie wrote the script and had to mix it with a part of Die Hard 2 and a part of Bad Santa and a little Home Alone.

Although nothing is especially new, it's a very standard action movie after all, it managed to feel refreshing and entertaining, and funny at the same time. The violence is so over the top, it almost becomes funny and something that makes the movie more appealing to a gore enthusiast like me.

It's only real flaw lies in some scenes that do not make sence. I would also have appreciated more background information on the characters, but it had taken too long. For me it will be a seven, but it was very close to an eight in rating.

I can strongly recommend this movie to enyone who likes to be entertained!",7,1,1
172,172,Violent Night,6.7,Action Comedy Crime,10-Dec-22,Good idea. Horrible execution.,"I loved the idea of having a badass Santa trying to save the day and all the scenes with David Harbour (Santa) . And that's about it.

Most of the dialogues and plot lines were extremely cheesy and cliche. I found the acting of the rest of the cast very poor and cringy, the script was very repetitive (how many ""I believe in you Santa"" can you squeeze into one movie; well take that and triple it).

In summary, +1 for the attempt to differentiate from traditional Christmas movies; the whole concept of seeing Santa beating people up while dropping cheesy Xmas lines is indeed entertaining +1 for David Harbour who portrayed Santa +1 for the production.",3,-1,-1

The crooks, led by John Leguizamo, make mince meat (pie?) out of the rent-a-cops at the estate & even when back-up arrives, it turns out they're in league w/Leguizamo so who can the beleaguered captives look toward for help; why the actual Santa Claus, David Harbour, of course! Meting out justice w/a sharpened candy cane & even a deadlier quip, Harbour engages the bad guys & dispatches them in a manner which would make the Toxic Avenger proud but w/all the spit & polish thrown into the narrative by director Tommy Wirkola (Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters/Dead Snow) you get the dreadful feeling of who was this made for? Surely not me since it's essentially an extended SNL skit or the opening gambit from 1988's Scrooged which involved Lee Majors, not something I should have to suffer 90 minutes through. To be honest me & my viewing buddy were off to see something else which we missed so this was the consolation prize...I rather have the lump of coal.

175,175,Agent Game,3.9,Action Thriller,13-Apr-22,It's surprisingly better than I expected,"Agent Game. Horrible title I agree but you know what? I didn't hate it!

Now don't get me wrong, this straight to streaming (or maybe it'll show in theaters for a week, who knows) stars Mel Gibson and a bunch of other people who'll have you saying ""hey! It's that guy/gal!"". For example we have Katie Cassidy of The Arrow fame where she played Black Canary (or Canaries, I lost count) as Miller a CIA agent, Barkahad Abdi of the now meme-worthy ""I am your Captain now"" fame as Omar, a wrongfully detained Muslim man, with Adan Canto from The Cleaning Lady (by the way, this show is really good, you should definitely give it a go) and Jason Isaacs who's does a ton of great voice work but who I remember most recently as the charismatic Captain Lorca from Star Trek: Discovery, all make appearances here.

Surprisingly the actors involved are doing their best to make this paint by numbers espionage thriller work and I appreciated that as these types of movies are best for playing while doing your household chores and yet I found myself actually paying attention to the story! I'm not saying it's a great story but it does have enough going for it to make things engaging at times. There aren't many action sequences so if you're going in hoping for them you'll have to be satisfied with a handful here and there and a larger set piece at the conclusion and the film actually sets itself up with an open ended finale, so I'm guessing they have a sequel in mind. Call me crazy but I'm not mad at the idea.

In a world filled with mediocre straight-to-stream movies, Agent Game is a tad better than the rest. Not a lot better, but certainly not the worst by a long shot. Trust me, I'm just as surprised as you are.",6,0,0

177,177,Agent Game,3.9,Action Thriller,09-Jun-22,What did I just watch?,"I went into this expecting the typical Bruce Willis barely-a-B-film, and thought Gibson took over Willis' reigns due to his illness. Wow I was wrong. Even the RT critics went hard on this at 15% and here with the current 3.8. Did everyone who gave this ones watch the same film as me? What is everyone expecting from a film these days?

This was a very impressively enjoyable non-stop action-thriller with constant suspense, especially with all the unexpected twists. The 90 min runtime was spot-on - I actually wanted more, and the pacing was perfect. The cinematography was excellent (the reviewer who said it was too dark, you need a new better TV) and the score was fitting and great, especially for a B film.

Considering this is newb director Grant S. Johnson's third film ever, I think he did a better job than some films from seasoned directors I've seen lately. And the two seasoned producers turned to newb writers did a decent job with the script. I'm not a fan of back and forth timelines, especially more than two, but they made it easy enough to follow, and I feel it was needed for the suspense and twists. Sure there were a few plot and technical issues, but no one attached to this film is a seasoned filmmaker, so some slack is to be expected.

So considering that this was put together by pretty much newb filmmakers, it was very impressive, especially considering the low budget. Had this film had a huge Hollywood budget and some assistance from experienced filmmakers, it could've easily been an A-film blockbuster.

Casting and performances were outstanding and convincing, especially the main characters. Gibson's small role was decent, but I wish he was in the story a little more. Sure we all wanted a better/more of an ending, but maybe the budget was exhausted and/or the ending left for a sequel. Either way, I'm fine with whichever, although I hope there is a sequel. The story in itself was very well thought out and not your typical cliched espionage/spy story. In fact, I'll even bet the CIA is responsible for many of the low ratings (ya, I said it), because I'm sure this film is close to reality in their international black ops.

I'll be watching this one again for sure, so ignore the ridiculous low ratings. This is not a 10, but a far cry from anything below a 6. Just the cinematography alone doesn't deserve anything lower than a 5. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me, and fingers crossed for a sequel.",8,1,1
178,178,Agent Game,3.9,Action Thriller,10-Apr-22,Resourceful is the word,"When you a paying customer, obviously you don't have to care about the hardships that came with the production of stuff you are buying. And yet again ""Agent Game"" is a film that demands a certain understanding of the kind of resourceful filmmaking that came into play here.

Mel Gibson and Jason Isaacs starred in a nine-digit budgeted ""Patriot"" over twenty years ago. So seeing them in a low-budget film feels as if they really fell hard. But other than that, the two of them along with Dylan McDermott really anchor this chamber piece that tries to play out as a topical spy thriller.

A couple of decent action sequences and veterans matching with current-ish TV performers like Katie Cassidy and Rhys Coiro make for a solid ensemble and the storyline isn't as convoluted as critics led you believe. No, it's nothing to write home about but it's a great device when you try to make a film on a shoestring budget with one great, one solid and some rather mid-level performers.

As a programmer this film works. The ending that implies further sequels seems a bit of unrealistic on producers' behalf but then again the open-ended climax may also amount to a resolution of sorts.

This is a B-movie concoction that works. If you are into that kind of thing. If you are into hate-watching, you could do a lot better with something a lot worse.",7,0,1

It started off great, then it fell into a very slow burn lull. If you can follow and get your head around the toing and froing of the various timelines, then the storyline might actually be interesting.

Mel Gibson must be hard up for work. He was substantially miscast; or, he couldn't deliver anything other than his usual schtick. There is more within him, as demonstrated in The Professor and the Madman (2019). But he didn't deliver it here, and the story didn't provide enough room for it.

Several of the performances were extremely competent, and carried the movie further than it otherwise would have gone before drowning -- namely, Annie Ilonzeh and Dermot Mulroney.

At this stage in his career, Mulroney has the potential to get cast as a more intelligent and sophisticated Sam Elliott. He is delivering similar ""cool swagger,"" so long as he doesn't actually try to do it, and thus overplay it. It's like the Clint Eastwood understated thing -- hint, hint.

Best to download this movie, and forward through the plotless scenes of gratuitous vioilence, unless you are a comicon gamer who thrives on the Ukraine War, the Iran-contra affair, and the dictatorships installed as USA banana republics, or the Shah of Iran.

Konney and Mike Langer had to offer with this movie.

Director Grant S. Johnson didn't really manage to put out something overly innovative or great here, and it was possibly because the storyline handed to him from writers Konney and Langer just wasn't all that encompassing. The storyline was a bit too simplistic and not enough of anything interesting happened throughout the course of one and a half hours, so the movie was bland, so very, very bland.

I have to say that the storyline put together for ""Agent Game"" was the reason why the movie flunked and sputtered, because the acting performances in the movie were actually fair enough, but the actors and actresses just hadn't sufficient material or storyline to work with.

If you enjoy action thrillers, then I would strongly suggest that you get your fix elsewhere, because ""Agent Game"" just simply doesn't cut it. Sure, it is a watchable movie, but the storyline is just a severe hindrance to the enjoyment of the movie. There are far better action thrillers out there in an abundance.

But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.

Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.

Watch ""RRR,"" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen.

But I can say that for large-scale, big-budget action movies, this is how you do it right. Hollywood isn't incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion, but many pale in comparison to RRR. Again without pointing out any movies in particular (because I don't know what's directly comparable), Hollywood should take notes.

RRR has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses those tropes well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.

The amazing action is probably what stands out the most, but at its core, this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated. There's some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie, but ultimately it's a good vs evil story that's pretty straightforward and honest about that, and thanks to the great characters and strong performances, that ends up being enough.

There's very little by way of slow scenes or dead air, and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good. I complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot, and so I was really happy to find that RRR does its action so well. Amazing stunts, great setups for the big set piece scenes, a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat (but not too much that it feels gratuitous), and a way of making things over-the-top in the best way possible (so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys). The two main heroes in this are almost superheroes, which arguably makes RRR the best superhero film in years.

Excellent stuff. A couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky English dialogue from the British characters is all I could criticise it for, and they're nitpicks. This is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime.",9,1,1

I saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it. I am glad I did, the dancing scene at the party was incredible. Arguably the scene was the best scene in the film.

It's about friendship and honor and wants and well everything Star Wars Prequels should have been. It's everything Marvel should have been.

Plot: It's about 2 men; a hero and the anti hero. One has duty, one has family.

It's an action movie, think what Avengers Civil War, Batman vs Superman should have been. In modern American movies, the overuse of CGI makes the movies look cheap. RRR has CGI and some places it does look a little cheap, but for a modern big budget film, it delivers.

208,208,RRR,7.9,Action Adventure Drama,25-Mar-22,"SS Rajamouli Delivers A Power Packed Action Entertainer Once Again, Made Only For Big Screen !!!","The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.

RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.

RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.

Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.

The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. The way Ramaraju's fiancé Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.

None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.

RRR is made for a big screen viewing. The cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner. Oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from Rajamouli now. The background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition, unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself. It numbs us into submission but post-interval as the pace falters a little, the pleasures dwindle too.

RRR is perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.",10,1,1
209,209,RRR,7.9,Action Adventure Drama,14-Apr-22,"probably the most brutally violent PG-13 in a while, plus a dance battle!","Total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a David Lean and as bloody and brutalist as Mel Gibson. It's certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former (well, duh, kids), but it also manages to be rapturously stupid it's gruesome violence than anything the latter would do. My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi ""here's a man with something to say... and it's LOUD and SLOW MO"" and I concur up to a point. And if you don't like British people, boys and girls have I got a smorgasbord of ""f the Brits"" for you (it's alright there's the one good lady one).

But what experiencing all 187 minutes of RRR truly is - and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time - is going to the All You Can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours: it's a somber and powerful war movie, a Gritty Run they the Jungle slaughter fest, a Cornball treatise on Friendship, a (at times very literally) fiery call to arms against the British or any Colonial power, a sliver of romance for good measure for Bheem, and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting Step Up dance-off movie. It's exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you're in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you're not with it by then, leave and don't come back.

I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns?

There is so much more heart in this movie than anything I've seen for a long while. It's nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action. But more than the great camera work and fantastic music (this movie sounds tremendous), RRR knows how to setup a story. From the very beginning, screentime is being used to setup payoffs later.

I can see the violence being an issue for some (though, RRR is not nearly as gory as many films, but it can feel brutal at times--enough that I can't really call this a family film).

There were elements in this movie that I have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor. The film is three hours long, but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story. The highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads. The instant rapport and harmony between Ram and Bheem is inspiring, which makes some of the later moments so poignant.

As a whole, RRR is over-the-top and big, but also subtle and real. In one moment I would be grinning ear to ear, in the next I was crying, and in the next I was gasping with excitement. Though there were elements I didn't fully understand, I can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and I am anxious to give it another watch.

Note: If watching at home, I would recommend watching this film in two or three parts. An intermission is helpful.

215,215,RRR,7.9,Action Adventure Drama,02-Dec-22,And the award for the most overrated film of 2022 goes too...,"RRR is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year. It's been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful Tollywood films of all time. My question is why?

I'm not familiar at all with Tollywood/Bollywood movies. This was the first one I've seen all the way through. But prior to watching RRR, I was familiar with all of the Bollywood clichés and have seen numerous infamous clips on YouTube. They're all very over the top with their presentation and acting, they're all very long, and they all include several dance/musical numbers. But I figured since this was the first Tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie, something that stood out and there really isn't.

As I was watching RRR I thought to myself, what if this was an American film and it featured the same story, the same action scenes, and the same length? I would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated, too tonally inconsistent, having bad CGI effects, terrible pacing, underdeveloped romantic subplots, and one-dimensional villains. But I guess since this is a Tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine? Do they add to the charm of this film? I don't know but I'm honestly low-key baffled by the reception that RRR is getting.

And I'm also baffled by how this Tollywood film looks just like every other Indian action film that has come out for the past several years. Seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other Indian blockbusters?

Here are a few positives I can give this film. There is some nice direction and cinematography, both of the lead actors have good chemistry, some of the action scenes are fun (some are also completely stupid) and sometimes the score is good (and sometimes it's not and very random). Clearly, Indian blockbuster films are just not for me, I'll acknowledge that. Cinema is subjective, so to the people who genuinely love this movie, I'm happy for you, but I still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and I still think it's easily the most overrated film to come out this year, by a lot.",5,0,0

There is no questioning this film's technical achievements, which are many. The CGI could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film. This begins with a girl in India being kidnapped by a British governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that, hundreds, if not thousands, die. Throw all logic out the window with this one. Everything in this film is over-the-top. The action, the story, the characters, the violence, even the music. It is beautiful to look at, no doubt, but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly, though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch, but turn off your brain before viewing. The actors put a lot into this, especially the two leads, but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are. Cecille B. DeMille would be envious.",6,-1,0
217,217,RRR,7.9,Action Adventure Drama,25-Mar-22,A weak writing sparkled by Rajamouli's extraordinary mass elements and Ram Charan & Jr. NTR's larger-than-life characters,"RRR (2022) : Movie Review -

High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with ""Saaho"" and ""Radhe Shyam"". Let's just accept the fact that a film like ""Bahubali : The Conclusion"" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.

RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.

RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what ""mass cinema"" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.

RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while ""Naacho Naacho,"" I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. ""Dosti"" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and ""Komuram Bheemudo"" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear ""Raamam Raaghavam"" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.

It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed ""Big-Screen Experience"" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and ""The Lion King"" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!

If this movies receive so much appreciation India should have had multiple Academy wins but that is not the case for two reasons. One, Indian movies are acquired taste and two 80% of Indian movies are not worth it anything, let alone international recognition, same like everywhere else. But the two factors combined really puts largest movie producing country in the world behind all the other countries.

Coming back to RRR, everything in this movie is way over the top and two protagonist are mightier than superheroes. Even Captain America will give in if barely given food for two weeks but our hero barely loses a muscle and he is not just hungry but wounded as well. Other protagonist doesn't even squeeze his eyebrows when whipped by barbed whip and doesn't flinch releasing wild animals in a party when there can be women and children present. The emotions are so basic and solution so convenient. Most Englishmen seen in the movie do not have a shred of decency and are de facto villains. Movie that is so colorful all the characters are either black or white. Compared to villains in this movie, Thanos will be a saint and Avengers will be ashamed of themselves for killing him.

Then one night she gets to know a guy while at the grocery store. They hit it off, and before we know it, they are off on a weekend vacation...

Couple of comments: this is the feature length debut of director Mimi Cave. Equally important, this is written by Lauryn Kahn (""Ibiza""). The way the movie is described by IMDb is utterly and completely misleading. This movie is not about ""the horrors of modern dating"". This is an outright scary movie, and a startling and disturbing one at that. I had no inkling whatsoever what was about to unfold. The movie is plot heavy so I really can't say much more about that. Even though the movie is unsettling, I will also say that this is one of the better movies I have seen so far this year. The two lead performances from Sebastian Stan (whom we saw most recently in ""Pam & Tommy""), and British up-and-coming actress Daisy Edgar-Jones, are tops. Kudos must go to both Lauryn Kahn (for coming up with this idea) and Mimi Cave (for implementing into onto the screen). As a complete aside, I recently saw ""Drive My Car"", where the opening credits started rolling 40 min into the movie, something I cannot recall having ever seen before. Well, guess what: the opening credits for ""Fresh"" start rolling only about 35 min into it!

""Fresh"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival, and not even two months later, it started streaming on Hulu. If you are in the mood for a scary movie that is at times disturbing and unsettling, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",8,1,1
226,226,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,16-Mar-22,"This is a fantastic ""new"" addition to the horror genre at a time horror fans are starved for something new and original","Fresh (2022) is a movie I recently watched on Hulu. The storyline follows a single lady a little desperate to find a half decent date. She finds a nice guy and they date for several weeks and then he pops the big question, ""would you like to take a cabin trip?"" She's excited and goes changing her life forever...

This movie is directed by Mimi Cave in her directorial debut and stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (War of the Worlds), Sebastian Stan (Captain America: Winter Soldier), Jojo T. Gibbs (Twenties), Dayo Okeniyi (See) and Andrea Bang (Luce).

The storyline for this is very well paced and delivered. I really liked the plot, characters and how the circumstances unfold. There is really good dialogue and chemistry between the characters and intensity in the circumstances. The horror elements are subtle and while I watched the film unfold I was a bit disappointed there wasn't much gore, especially with this premise; however, the ending is so strong and well done it makes up for it.

Overall this is a fantastic ""new"" addition to the horror genre at a time horror fans are starved for something new and original. I would score this an 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9,1,1
227,227,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,01-May-22,One of 2022's unexpected surprises,"A refreshingly unpredictable and off-kilter debut feature from director to watch Mimi Cave, Fresh is a horror hybrid with killer energy and memorable lead turns from its main duo Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan, as the two play their parts in a depraved and gripping tale that refuses to play to convention as Edger-Jones Noa finds herself in a whole new world when she begins dating Stan's charismatic doctor Steve.

Best suited for viewing with as little knowledge as to the content as possible, even if there must be a warning that Fresh is a very mature and unashamedly bloody film from the Disney catalogue, Cave's film acts as a confident example of a debut film as you're likely to see in 2022 and as the film lulls you into a nice sense of security in its opening 30 minutes before its credits hits and true nature becomes apparent, Fresh never lets up on a wild journey that will have you gasping, laughing and contemplating outcomes until the finale concludes.

Examining modern dating trends and hot topic issues without every forcing them into the narrative or hammering us over the head with them, first and foremost Cave is determined to create an energetic and gripping film and her work with screenwriter Lauryn Kahn is a sight to behold as the two talented minds join together a genre mash-up that expertly balances romance, comedy, horror and thriller tropes into one cohesive package that gives Marvel veteran Sebastian Stan another solid indie role and Daisy Edger-Jones a significant moment amongst many upcoming efforts that is likely to see the actress become the next big thing in Hollywood.

Having similar traits to Carey Mulligan's recent turn in the well-received Promising Young Woman, Edgar-Jones is a revelation here as Noa and after years of strong work in notable TV shows, Fresh marks a career moment for the performer whose likely to shoot way up the pecking order in 2022 on the back of this and soon to be released products such as event series Under the Banner of Heaven with Andrew Garfield and high profile adaptation feature film Where the Crawdads Sing.

Moving brilliantly between vulnerable, in charge, determined and trodden down, Edgar-Jones owns the entirety of Fresh from its humble beginnings through to its unforgiving end and even if some may find the subject matter of Cave's film too hard to bare, it's likely the can't turn away from it performance of Edgar-Jones will win over viewers who normally may not partake in such delicacies as Fresh places before them.

Final Say -

Sometimes hard too stomach, Fresh won't be for everyone but it marks a significant moment in the soon to be superstar life of Daisy Edgar-Jones and directional career of Mimi Cave, as the two combine to create one of 2022's most unexpected gems.

228,228,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,03-Mar-22,Fresh,"8/10 - Daisy Edgar-Jones, Sebastian Stan, and Jojo T. Gibbs all turn in solid performances in this unique, wonderfully weird, slightly repulsive, and entrancing horror comedy (with a fantastic payoff) that is perfect for fans of fellow Searchlight release, Ready or Not.",8,1,1
229,229,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,13-Mar-22,It needed a bit more seasoning...,"I must admit that I was initially intrigued by the synopsis for this 2022 thriller titled ""Fresh"" from writer Lauryn Kahn and director Mimi Cave. However, I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. But with it being a new movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to give the movie a viewing.

And while the concept idea behind ""Fresh"" certainly was interesting or fresh, pardon the pun, then it was a movie that was oddly bland and generic. Sure, there were aspects to the storyline that had weight and leverage to it, but overall, then the movie was just lacking spice, pardon the pun.

Sure, it was a fun jab at today's meat market with the dating apps and services, I get that, but at the same time the movie was just a bit too generic and predictable.

""Fresh"" has a relatively small cast ensemble, but I will say that the actors and actresses in the movie definitely rose to the occasion and carried the movie quite well. It was just a shame that they had so little to work with in terms of a properly entertaining and enjoyable script. I was not familiar with the cast that performed in the movie, so that was something that I enjoyed at least.

Visually then ""Fresh"" was adequate. It is not a gory movie, as director Mimi Cave doesn't delve into the full-blown gore and macabre. Most of the gruesome things are left to the imagination, for better or worse.

I found ""Fresh"" to be suitable for a single viewing, but that was about it. This is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as the storyline just simply doesn't have the ingredients to support more than a single serving, pardon the pun.

My rating of ""Fresh"" lands on a very bland five out of ten stars.",5,0,0
230,230,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,04-Mar-22,Not a comedy,"First of all, there is not a single minute of this movie that would classify it as a comedy. It is a dark and disturbing suspense/horror movie.

231,231,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,21-Jan-22,Entertaining Debut,"Fresh depicts the horrors of modern dating seen through one young woman's defiant battle to survive her new boyfriend's unusual appetites. This movie goes pretty off the rails and for good reason. Writer Lauryn Kahn is no stranger to rom-coms having several flops in the past. For this feature, she toys around with the horror genre to give a unique perspective both taken literally and metaphorically. The first 30-minutes are setup like a pleasing romantic movie. I quite enjoyed that beginning. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan have a cute relationship and great chemistry, which lasts throughout. After that first half hour, the movie starts to pick up and show a darker side. In fact, the opening credits don't happen until then. What comes next is absurd and chilling. Without Mimi Cave's direction, her feature debut fun fact, I doubt the movie would work. She makes this both an uncomfortable and entertaining watch all together. Her techniques may not all be foreign to the horror genre and it definitely can be predictable at times, yet I feel she pulls it off.

I mentioned our two leads before, and they get even better as the movie progresses. Edgar-Jones gives a fully committed performance proving once again she's a great newcomer within the past few years. I really liked her character and how she's able to pull of a good performance to please others in the most desperate of times. Sebastian Stan does well in this role and is completely mesmerizing. Once this hits Hulu in March, there are going to be a few meme-able moments with him and quite the talk surrounding his character. Another good performance comes from Jojo T. Gibb's as the friend trying to piece this mystery together. There's a couple characters that make their entrance but feel like they serve no purpose once they get their time to shine. In the climax, I expected more from them but their works are easily resolved. And the movie ends abruptly if you ask me. As a whole, the runtime is close to two hours. It overstays its welcome with scenes that go nowhere and a few missing pieces never to return to. As much as I liked the beginning, I feel as if that could've been chopped down some even though the half hour mark throws you in for a loop. Not everything is entirely new and it could be better, but the performances and Mimi Cave's work pulls it together. This will for sure gain a cult following in the future and connect with some in such a way. I can't say it all worked for me, it's a bit messy and too long, but still a solid watch.",7,0,1
232,232,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,17-Apr-22,Works on every level,"'Fresh' explores one of my greatest fears. Ever since I saw a particular scene in 'Hostel: Part 2' the concept has really bothered me. I won't say what it is because the surprise element is one of the great things this movie has going for it. All I'll say is it bothered me greatly.

This film works on every level. If it was just a straight up love story, I would've loved it. A love story with a very dark twist though - brilliant. The characters are what sell this. They are given such great dialogue to work with that you can't help but love them.

I've found that when a film has the class and audacity to start its opening credits over 30 minutes into the runtime (see also 'Drive my Car') it is almost always a good sign. It's a sign that the film isn't playing by the rules. Nothing is off the cards and anything could happen at any time. I love that.

I can't remember the last occasion the runtime of a movie went by so quickly. I loved every minute of this film and can't recommend it highly enough. 9/10.",9,1,1

""FRESH is an unforgettably shocking start to another Sundance Film Festival, holding all of the characteristics to end up as one of the absolute favorites.

Mimi Cave delivers an extraordinarily captivating, assertive directorial debut, taking Lauryn Kahn's original, gruesome screenplay to the next level. Sebastian Stan demonstrates his ludicrous range, while Daisy Edgar-Jones gives a breakthrough performance that may warrant a couple of awards by the end of the festival.

With an extremely engaging yet too quick first act, the viewers are immediately grabbed by the endearing love story that slowly builds up to a brutally impactful revelation, leading the movie into a rabbit hole of (in)tense, suspenseful, surprising developments.

234,234,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,10-Apr-22,Exciting ... she's so exciting/inviting to me,"You may also think of the Kool & the Gang song when you hear the word Fresh. But the movie has nothing to do with the song - well not in a traditional sense. I reckon if you have a twisted mind (which is not a bad thing to have, if you want to enjoy this twisted movie - see what I did there?), you may see some connections.

One of the connections might be that the movie has music and dancing in it. And in a sense it is about females being ""Fresh"" - in the dating world you ask? Well - that is how the movie starts off. Our main character looking to find someone who is a match as we say nowadays I think. And while the online connections (including offers and DMs she did not ask for) are anything but promising, it looks like real life has brought her someone, who actually could be a good catch (pardon the pun).

The actors are really doing a great job, Stan being as charismatic as he can be. Especially interesting considering how shy he seems to be in real life (at least judging from his interviews). Overall re-fresh-ing take on something we may have seen already many times. Good movie then - but one you need a strong stomach for (I know you are here for the puns, you are welcome)",8,1,1
235,235,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,09-Mar-22,I like the two lead actors but this is just silly,"Daisy Edgar-Jones of ""Normal People"" fame and Sebastian Stan currently portraying Tommy Lee in ""Pam & Tommy"" have cemented themselves as favorites in my book, so just seeing their names attached to this project turns this into a must-see. Furthermore, the premise description and trailer are respectful enough not to give out spoilers, and instead the movie actually goes out of its way to keep the mystery until about 50 minutes into the story. When it gets going though, it's all silly, full of contrived moments. However, the one specific revenge act is quite satisfying to watch, I must admit. Overall this is a mixed bag, which you can actually follow along by just having it playing in the background while doing something else.",5,0,0
236,236,Fresh,6.7,Horror Thriller,21-Mar-22,Strong performances,"'Fresh' is very good - strong performances and perfectly chosen music are the main reasons for that.

I wouldn't say it's perfect, just because I don't think it nails the split between humour and seriousness but apart from that it's a terrifically made film. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan give excellent showings, while the music throughout is top notch. It's nicely paced and has an interesting story. Definitely one I'd recommend.",8,1,1

What could have been an intriguing horror, however, sadly proves to be just as basic as the premise it begins with. Although the cast does well with what they are given, the most interesting characters are not fully illustrated, creating a missed opportunity to study the characters and their mindsets. This film attempts to be an homage to psychological horror films but lacks the screen presence and insightful characters to do so. The tone is inconsistent, with serious issues being portrayed horrifyingly real while having the killer be over-the-top in his execution. The cinematography while at times spectacular also has a basic look to it that makes the film feel cheap and generic. The film also recycles plot elements of better-executed films, making this one feel lost in the mix. By no means is this an abomination to cinema, but because of its generic characteristics, lacks the elements to feel memorable, creating an overall missed opportunity of an intriguing concept.",4,-1,-1

Daisy Edgar-Jones gives a superb lead performance with a character that's easy to empathize and root for. She also has great natural chemistry with Sebastian Stan, who is phenomenal in a role that goes completely against his usual type.

Mimi Cave's direction is excellent, super stylish and inventive. The soundtrack is amazing, full of songs so ironic for their corresponding scenes it's perfect. The music by Alex Sommers is also great, effectively haunting yet beautiful.",9,1,1

The music was delightful too. I don't like gore films but this one is quite tame in that department. I would call this a psychological horror with some comic relief where it's needed but make no mistake... it's not a comedy.",10,1,1

Both the leads were freaking amazing. Who would tell the film would take such a shady, twisted turn after the first half an hour of mild courtship. Now hear me out, do yourself a favour and go in blind, don't watch any of the trailers, or read any kind of synopsis for that matter as they might spoil the fun. Believe me, if you do just I say, you are in for a bucket full of surprises!

If you ask me, I just finished watching it, and I'm sitting in complete silence, don't know what to say, I've lost for words right now. What was that? Like seriously? What was it? Never in my wildest imaginations, I would see such a turn of events panning out. It's been a while since I've got this much of a shock factor from a Movie. I don't remember the last time I was this much bewildered, stunned. Now the film isn't flawless per se, there are indeed some problems yet I must confess, this is one of the best works I have seen in current times.

It's gruesome, it's nasty, and it takes pride in showcasing the aspects of Blood & Gore. Be careful though, the film's subject is very much catered towards the people who love gore more than anything else. So, if you are a sensitive person, if the sight of blood or meat makes you uncomfortable, well just keep your distance. As some of the scenes will make you sick to your stomach. Trust me, I would like to share more details, but I won't do that. As a reviewer and a fellow cinephile, I want everybody to watch this.

A new refreshing horror. The premise itself isn't really that special. A normal girl falling for a methodically psychopathic man is a pretty popular movie genre. But what made this movie somehow still feel new was the amazing editing. There were many cool visuals that seemed to maybe glorify the fk-up practice. It's weird but man it became wild. Sebastian Stan was the perfect charming predator who enjoyed his craft. Finally the way the story ended was pretty awesome.

I loved there's one part where it mock the genre. It had to do with the black dude who came to the house. It was unexpectedly funny.

Still it had some weird plot. There's still the old cheesy only-hit-the-killer-once-to-knock-him-out-instead-of-killing-him-when-you-have-the-chance trope that annoyed me. The ending felt a bit unfinished because there's still a guy left.

The premise is good, the film is stylish, there is some cool editing here and there, some references are funny and it tries to say something (predatory relationships, how men treat women, current dating culture).

However, this feels like fake. A film created by privileged people for priviliged people, trying really hard to check all the boxes. It has his audience, that audience will like it because it will see themselves represented but it does so so so little with the material, not going any deeper in anything it tries to explore. All the characters are what you expect them to be: stereotypical as hell. The horror? Nope. You clearly notice this was made by someone in LA, NY or any other big american city. It doesn't have the rawness we would see in a story like this from a French or a Japanese director. It's unbelievable how a cannibalism story can be this boring, but here we are.

An interesting - not that great, but creates the right mood - first act, good final 15 minutes and between that a terribly generic and almost empty second act. It tires really hard to be the new Promising Young Woman, but it's pretty forgetable.",5,-1,0

First, the main characters were great. Great chemistry between them and acceptable acting. Don't expect Oscar winning here and you'll be fine.

Second, the script is just OK, not really fresh, because you'll end the movie still with so many unanswered questions.

Last, music here is the best. Great selection of songs for some funky kind of gory moments. Really refreshing.

Flat, bad acting. Sebastian Stan is hamming it up, and he's the only decent part of this movie.

Awful dialogue and script. For some reason, the screenwriter seems to be half-black, but she wrote every black person like a goddamn stereotype out of 90s RomCom. Such a predictable and generic script that felt like it was written by an AI.

Also some decent shots in this movie but overall the movie was very poorly lit and the digital cinematography was flat and ugly. Is it really that hard to shoot on actual film? This director knows her way around a camera but she really does not know how to light a scene (especially at night). Also, this will most likely be some of the worst editing I'll see all year for a movie, I understand what they're going for, but it's incredibly ineffective and distracting

But even worse the acting performances by Cristophter Waltz and Willem Dafoe were bland. As if they were speed reading their lines without any real gusto.

This is Walter Hill being Walter Hill. Gritty, realistic, devoid of Technicolor fluff. The landscape is unpleasant, uninviting, because that's what it is in this area of the southwest. People are living on the hard edge, because there isn't much else.

This tale, in the mold of The Professionals and The Wild Bunch, is not in the same category as The Undefeated. There's no sweetness and light, just the reality people of this era faced.

Yes some stars in the film are more known today as support cast but they are great actors and they have responded positively in the film.

He hasn't made much recently so I was really excited to hear of Dead for a Dollar. I was further encouraged by Christoph Waltz and Willem Dafoe taking on the roles of protagonist and antagonist respectably. However I was badly disappointed by the result. Apparently based on true events, Dead for a Dollar is a low budget badly written western with heavy overtones of racism and sexism. Christoph Waltz doesn't give a convincing performance as the bounty hunter with a heart however Willem Dafoe does better.

This film could've used the help of a Quentin Tarantino to add some inspiration to an actual story. To categorize this movie as a thriller western is a blatant fabrication of fact. And the set production was abysmally cheap. What were they thinking here on a shoestring budget?

Script craters are juxtaposed with awkward dialogue, a dated view of feminism and racism, and underwhelming performances by usually phenomenal actors. All peppered with technical errors visible even by those who detain no special knowledge in this field. It is difficult to find even one aspect of the film to compliment, perhaps only the fact that unlike many of today's releases, it has the decency to stay under two hours in length. In any case, it remains a light and entertaining movie to watch for all its errors, as a lesson in how a film usually should not be made.",3,-1,-1

The scenes were a bit choppy and kept waiting for a tv commercial to play between them.

Pretty sure I nodded off at one point and missed some, but it made no difference.

This was a western, I think, but not one I'd recommend for western movie watchers. The actors are top notch but just couldn't save it.

I would have tried for a spaghetti western vibe over this 50s American tv series type. The scenes with Waltz and Dafoe were good but the writing, no sir, I didn't like it.

Always been a fan of Walter Hill, and this just being a Walter Hill film, raises it in my eyes. I enjoyed the script foe the most part, the acting, and the general pacing of the movie. It does feel a bit studio produced, with very crisp digitally feeling shots, not quite as dusty and dirty as maybe it should be. There is also a very minimalistic soundtrack, which makes the whole thing feel a bit like a TV movie. Still, it' s a enjoyable movie, reminiscent of the Spaghetti Westerns of old.",7,0,1

The movie is classical low budget fare and that's just fine. It delivers what is expected with strong performances across the board. Perhaps I would feel differently had I paid fifteen bucks at a theater...but as a streaming film on Showtime, Dead for a Dollar is golden bargain to be appreciated if not treasured...and yes, it's something of a morality tale in which some degree of justice is realized, along with strongly implicit anti-racist and anti-sexist messaging.",9,1,1

Sometimes it looked very cheap and not only because of the decor. I thought there were a lot of bad decisions made by the editing team. Fading out from one scene to another, it didn't look good, itlooked like a cheap soap episode, a television movie of low quality. The colour tones were also not the best choice, made it look done by amateurs again. Disappointing for Walter Hill. The cast wasn't bad, well at least not all of them. Willem Dafoe and Christoph Waltz are both actors that can do very well in such roles, and they were not really disappointing but since the quality of certain scenes was quite low their acting didn't really made the movie good. You could say we were lucky with them, with any other mediocre actor this movie would have completely plummeted. The story had potential for a good western but the execution wasn't what to expected.

At least that's what I was thinking before I saw the trailer, which was already a little underwhelming, to say the least.

Unfortunately, the first impression didn't deceive: Everything here feels amateurish almost beyond belief. From the ""color grading"", which is really just a sepia filter reminiscent of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 3, to the cinematography, the most obvious CGI blood and smoke as well as the editing with its constant and obnoxious fade-outs. If anyone would have told me that this is an amateur production made for YouTube, I would have believed them in an instant.

The story is as generic as they come, the writing especially in the first act extremely uninspired, accompanied by wooden acting. If Christoph Waltz playing a bounty hunter sounds promising and somewhat exciting to you, make no mistake: He is the blandest I have ever seen him here. Always a joy to watch though and probably the only bright spot in this mess is Willem Dafoe - although his character ultimately surves no purpose for the main narrative.

It's always baffling to witness former great directors reaching late-career lows - Brian De Palma would come to mind here. The problem isn't that Hill tried to make a B movie, as he successfully did before. DEAD FOR A DOLLAR is unfortunately just bad.",3,-1,-1

It felt like a story a lucky grown up would write because he saw a western when he was a kid and someone gave him a lot of money and too much time on their hands.

Its a good movie that i found to have engaging dialogue and interesting characters. There was an unnecessary excess of fade to black shots that i started to get annoyed at; however, i enjoyed the cinematography a lot throughout the film.

The story serves well enough to move things along and most are adequate in their roles but the photography is so flat, colours so drained and sets look more like a cheap soap opera than a feature film.

But now back to the Tyree character. I feel like he and the Sargent Polk gentleman could star in their own western where they team up and rob trains and banks and then realize their crimes and try to go straight.

Judicious and sparse scoring creates a sort of uneasy isolation as dry as the Sante Fe desert.

There are some departures from Western tropes; the good guys here are flawed....and murderous. Of course, the bad guys are too.

Luis Chavez is sooo good. Somebody please tell him. His role is easy to overlook, but if there is a sequel.....that's the story to tell, for sure; his origin story.....or maybe a sort of 1890s ""Better Call Saul"".

There is a bit of a misstep in the script balancing the abominable racism and sexism of the period with today's sensibilities. You'll know it when it happens. And the brief nudity seemed intrusive...it pulled me out of the action bit. I expect there was something there that I missed.

Rachel Brosnahan is terrific in a character we haven't seen much before: a woman as hard as the times, and up to the task.

This western covers all the bases moral, immoral and amoral. Christoph Waltz excels as the amoral bounty man, Willem Dafoe shines as the bad guy Joe Cribbens and Warren Burke represents law and order.

Bounty hunter Max Borlund (Christoph Waltz) warns criminal gambler Joe Cribbens (Willem Dafoe) to never cross his path again after release from prison. Max gets hired by well-connected Martin Kidd (Hamish Linklater) to retrieve his wife Rachel Kidd (Rachel Brosnahan). Rachel has been supposedly kidnapped by Army deserter Elijah Jones (Brandon Scott) and held for ransom in Mexico. Max is partnered with Elijah's fellow soldier Sergeant Poe (Warren Burke). Tiberio Vargas (Benjamin Bratt) is a Mexican bandit leader.

These are some big actors. I don't like the cinematography and I kept wondering who got these actors in this film. It's Hollywood legend Walter Hill. The problem is that he hasn't directed a good movie in this century. He's trying for an old spaghetti western. Christoph Waltz is able to carry the movie on his back. Dafoe and Burke are standouts among the rest. The dialogue is trying, but clunky. There are lines that just aren't quite right. It needs a script doctor to work it over a few times. The direction is almost there, but it looks a little off. That can be forgiven for a newcomer with a bad cinematographer. Walter is an old hand. One cannot overlook that.",6,-1,0
275,275,Skinamarink,5.1,Horror,23-Jan-23,I really tried,"I went into this movie completely blind (as I try to do with most movies) and can say without question this is NOT a movie you want to go in blind. This movie is extremely experimental and abstract and will not be to most people's taste. The entire film is shot with a grainy vhs type look and is comprised of deliberately off center shots of the interior of a house. There is virtually no plot to speak of and most of the 1 hour 40 minute runtime is composed of random shots.

I love films that challenge and are demanding to the viewer. I love independent cinema and slow burn films. But this film expects WAY too much from the viewer and becomes very irritating as a result. Even to the hardened art house viewer this movie expects too much. This would have made a brilliant 40 minute short as there are moments of true horror but they are surrounded by random repetitive imagery. At no point does this movie pick up pace or have any sort of narrative.

This movie feels like a nightmare ASMR or a full length creepy pasta. If you suffered from night terrors or sleep paralysis or experienced childhood trauma I think you could become extremely invested in this film and that is the only way this works. I didn't feel connected or engaged in the story (I've never been through any of the above) and the only film I can compare with regards to the pacing and somnolent effect this movie had is ""Beyond the Black Rainbow"".

It's extremely boring, nothing happens on screen, but I do have to say the jump scares got me GOOD. Some parts were very creepy and it had great atmospheric potential and I could see the vision they had, but it felt more like a grad school project with a budget of $10.

I admire what he did, the execution is excellent and I was immediately drawn into the atmosphere that the film exudes. However, as other reviewers have noted, this would have made a decent short film, maybe 20 minutes. As it stands, it overplays it's hand dramatically and had me begging to be relinquished from the monotony of the long takes which comprise the film's bloated runtime.

It's also very efficient creating suspense and tension. I can't say the same about Skinamarink, which is mostly boring.

Here we have a set of disconnected images that never manage to justify the existence of a long feature film, let alone its duration of almost 100 minutes. The last 5 minutes are fine.

281,281,Skinamarink,5.1,Horror,18-Jan-23,A chilling finale did not make up for the boring events leading up to it,"All the people saying this film is plotless are wrong. There is a plot here, although it is extemely vague and thin. Might be one of the thinnest plotlines I've ever seen and that is what caused the film to be at times unbearably boring for me. I actually enjoyed the aesthetic for the film, the faceless characters, the low light, lofi camera work. It's a style that could present a high creep factor with the proper story to go along with it. This is not that story.

I will say this is much better than the director's previous effort 'Heck', which is basically the short film that started this one. It feels like the director has a better grip on the style he's presenting here. That still doesn't make up for the lack of story here.

The film opens with one of the children falling down the stairs and this starts the chain of events that make me believe the child actually died when this happened and he is living in some purgatory or hell. What follows after this could only be described as mean spirited and harsh, but it unfolds so slowly that you feel like you're just watching paint dry. There are some suitably creepy moments but they are few and far between. Actually there is maybe about 3 or 4 creepy scenes in the entire film, the ending being far and wide the most uncomfortable. Had me looking over my shoulder as I was leaving the theater.(I had the whole theater to myself, I'm assuming due to bad weather, but it was probably the best way to watch this film as isolation is a major theme.) The ending felt like I was being personally talked to by the faceless, out of focus boy and I hated it, but in a good way.

All in all, I still couldn't call this a good movie and it will only appeal to a very niche horror crowd. I commend the director for creating something so different. I just wish there was as much thought put into the story as there was in the shooting style.

A book that has a similar theme of a house that has rooms that constantly change, people disappear etc. And as someone that has grown up watching experimental films, as well as listening to and making experimental music, I thought the pace of the film was just right.

The power of suggestion is always a good thing, and the fact that there was little footage of actual people present here works well. It added to the sense of isolation in the house. The whispering too was a nice touch. The children sensed there was something there.

Something about this film invoked a sense of dread in me that I haven't felt in 40 years. It wasn't the thing lurking in the dark that spoke to the children, though. It was the dark itself. It was the unlit corners. It was the absence of the comfort of a parent. It was the strange glow of the TV in a dark room when your unsure of your surroundings. It was that door you left open just a crack.

Yes, Kyle Edward Ball's audaciously odd directorial debut is about 25-30 minutes too long, edited in such a way that too many shots overstay their welcome.

Yes, it is filmed in a manner to seemingly intentionally test an audience's patience with still shots that hide the characters' faces and set aside narrative momentum in favor of metaphorical experimentation.

This will bother, and clearly has bothered, a lot of people. And I get it. It's not what they wanted. No hard feelings to these people. But now I want to talk about why I loved this film.

I was absolutely gripped by Skinamarink. I found so much depth and meaning to come from its bare-bones visual and aural presentation.

It's so, so ambiguous. But that didn't bother me because rather than showing bizarre imagery for the sake of it like so many experimental films, Ball instead keeps a GREAT deal of unknown in each frame.

The creaky, eerie sound complimented the ever-shifting static of the cinematography to make my brain play all kinds of tricks on me. A handful of horrifying disturbing images make an appearance throughout the film, but the constant wondering of ""what was that sound"" or ""did I see something move in the frame"" made me just as on edge throughout.

Though short on plot, I still found surprising thematic/character depth in each of the movie's unsettling, eerie frames of a single house.

We don't get to know much about Kevin and Kaylee, but we know what kind of relationship they have as young siblings from the film's opening scenes, and it is so soul-crushing to see what happens and doesn't happen to them over the story's nightmarish happenings.

As these kids are stalked in their house by something unknown and unseen, the horrifying things we see and hear are so clearly indicative of common childhood fears, traumas, and challenges: divorce, nightmares, abandonment, neglect, death, and a lack of control over your own choices.

Seeing them play out on screen in such an uncanny way was so sad and so terrifying. The film's lack of a musical score, lack of concrete answers, piercing sound design, and ability to turn the intimacies of childhood into faceless, unknowable antagonists all made this one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.",9,1,1

1. Do you like weird camera angles that focus on the tops of doorways and only show people from their ankles down?

It played on Friday the 13th, no less. In the same theater I saw this, Friday the 13th part 6 was playing 2 hours later. Figuring that F13 was a later movie, and I'd seen it numerous times, why not check out a new movie?

I figured wrong.

This is definitely the worst movie I've sat through in my entire life...and that's even after sitting through Pet Sematary 2019, and Halloween Ends.

This movie was filmed like a child was trying out his dad's camcorder and didn't properly know how to use it. As if he held the camera in one place, and moved his head instead of the camera, thinking he was recording what his own eyes see.

There was no storyline. There was no acting. There were barely any faces. There were about 5 unnecessary jump scares, as in, nothing at all was happening when there was just a jump scare for the sake of calling it a horror movie.

I don't think I ever walked out at the end of a movie where the audience was in complete silence trying to have this abomination that passes as cinema sink in. I also don't think I finished a movie and had been as angry as I was to have wasted my time actually going to a theater in hopes of actually seeing a scary movie.

Just watch the trailer over and over and it will basically have the same effect as the actual movie. The trailer, though intriguing, and leaves you with a desire to see it just to know what it's about, is exactly what the movie's about...nothing.",1,-1,-1

It's like a couple kids tried to do a Blair Witch style movie and forgot to make it scary.

I cannot fathom how people found this scary. Seeing Grandma naked is way more scary than this snore fest.

I read the reviews first, then watched and waited, with baited breath, for something scary. Like hoping to win the mega ball or that million dollar scratch ticket, I was sorely disappointed. If you find this scary, sleep with the lights on, don't go outside, ever, and never, ever interact with another human being. I've been more scared of Pokeman cartoons than this movie. Seriously, the scariest part were the legos on the floor, because stepping on those are horrible. This is not a horror movie, it's just horrible.",1,-1,-1
290,290,Skinamarink,5.1,Horror,08-Jan-23,WTF?,"My hometown isn't exactly known for great movies being produced there, nevermind having great film-makers, so I was hoping that this film would at least break that curse due to the traction that it has been getting.

I must also add some positives here and add congrats to the film-maker for completing their project. Making a movie is no small task, on any budget.

Sadly that's where the positives begin and end. I've never in my life seen something so boring, I think I've enjoyed watching paint dry more. The shots are lifeless, the sound is horrendous, and my god what in the heck was that final shot?

This is a new low in filmmaking. It had nothing redeeming about it, even the most bad films have something you can get out of it but this is just some half assed b.s. Labelled as artsy.

If someone could break the curse of terrible filmmaking from my city that would be great, unfortunately that is not the case with Skinamarink.

Stay away, stay far away!",2,-1,-1
291,291,Skinamarink,5.1,Horror,18-Jan-23,Too minimalist but what do you expect for 15k,"I did not dislike this movie. It was more or less exactly what I expected. As a fan of the creepy aesthetic of David Lynch and movies that challenge the audience I wasn't too disappointed. I love the concept and appreciate the approach but ultimately if you are going to ask an audience for 90-120 minutes of their time I think a film should give them more than Skinamarink delivers. Still, from a first time filmmaker it's an admirable effort.

I far prefer slow burning horror films that play to the fear of the unknown and an have an underlying sense of dread (The Witch, Hereditary, and The Blair Witch Project are personal faves). Skinamarink tries to play in this arena but doesn't effectively use any cinematic tools to build tension or make the viewer anxious. No soundtrack, very little camera movement, and not enough dynamic use of light and shadow. All things that I think probably could have been achieved, even with a miniscule budget. Thematically it starts in a very minable vein but then doesn't actually develop what amounts to a fairly universal experience of fear (i.e. Being a defenseless child abandoned by caregivers). We feel isolated and alone with the children but are distanced from the sense that anything frightening is happening I think because so little of the film takes place from the children's perspective. It did get me thinking about how to make a horror movie driven by fear of the unknown. If you want to make something universally scary how much do you need to show the audience to prime them to be afraid and how much can you leave to their imaginations? In the end Skinamarink asks the individual viewer to fill in too many blanks for it to be an effective horror movie in my opinion. Truly neurotic people will probably find it unnerving and anxiety inducing but aside from a couple of cheap jump scares nothing particularly interesting happens. My impression was that the vast majority of people will most likely find the movie a waste of time and for that reason I cannot recommend it. But if you like a challenge, are home alone on a stormy night, and/or are capable of letting your imagination run wild then, sure, give it a shot.",5,0,0
292,292,Skinamarink,5.1,Horror,14-Jan-23,The Rebirth of Primal Childhood Fears - A Reward for the Patient,"""Skinamarink"" is undoubtedly one of the most unique viewing experiences in my existing memory, and it's rather challenging for me to truly pinpoint my own reaction and opinion of it. Depending on your taste, it can be equal parts a liminal horror masterpiece and a true tedium. I know one thing to be true, it requires absolute attention and maximum immersion to get out of it all that director Kyle Edward Ball intended to do to you.

Two little children, 5 year old Kaylee and her 4 years old brother Kevin, wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished. Definitely sounds like a concept to bring a lot of creeps. And so it does. ""Skinamarink"" starts out with the slowest pacing I've ever experienced, and during the first 20-30 minutes one might feel the temptation to give up on this film. The entire cinematography, the sum of the 100 minute runtime consists almost exclusively of obscure shots of just about everything in the (director's childhood) house, except people. You practically don't see character's faces at all, only legs. Ceiling. Walls. Furniture. Darkness, a lot of darkness, holding within itself the dreadful sense than anything can come into your eyes and mind at any given time. The screen is full of grain and 70's-like screen scratches, the depthless dark keeps morphing, and the sense of dread is creeping-crawling around every corner of every frame. You know that weird, scary pile of clothes in your room in the middle of the night? This is that: the movie. It's an absolute trump move to put such youngins as main characters, the rebirth of your most primal childhood fears is what Kyle Edward Ball wants to offer you. Most people seek the kind of comfort an ignorant bliss they had as young children, but director of ""Skinamarink"" serves just the opposite of that spectrum.

It's a liminal, esoteric, ambient, analogue, lo-fi horror if I've ever seen one. And made with palpable, impressive confidence. Slowly, very slowly, but surely, ""Skinamarink"" lulls one into the deep sense of unease, hiding short, momentary glimpses of absolute terror inbetween long periods of almost sheer ambient nothingness. It's a movie that rewards the patient. Ball gives us a playground in which our imagination will do more work than the movie itself, and that's not a negative critique, but quite the feat.

""Skinamarink"" creates a tiny yet massive world, from which there is no escape. Days after seeing it, I'm still trying to grasp what I saw, and on what scale I enjoyed it. This film has gotten the kind of buzz no art can buy, and rightly so, I believe it will be remembered as cult film, perhaps even as a revolutionary kind of horror. My rating: 7/10.",7,1,1
293,293,Skinamarink,5.1,Horror,09-Jan-23,Not for everyone!,"One of, if not the most unconventional horrors I have ever confronted, and it was precisely this unconventionality that drew me to it in the first place, and it necessitates no explanation that it grew on me over time.

Now I can understand if it does not appeal at all to someone, and I can also see why this film may not sit well with the vast majority of the audience, as it contains numerous elements that could be off-putting. For example, the film's visual aesthetics consist primarily of a timeline of grainy, noise-filled imageries, as if they were processed with an Instagram filter.

They did have the desired effect on me though; at first I was sceptical, but I eventually became captivated. Not only was I completely absorbed in it, I was also terrified of all the bizarre events that followed thencefoth.

A scintillating sound design with a perceptible ASMR vibe further amplified my experience, and I found myself in a genuinely terrifying situation where I could not predict what was going to happen next, which I believe made it more disconcerting, more frightful.",8,1,1

Just when I had my fill there was still like way to much of the movie left. It has no business being this long. Most of the scenes in this film are highly irrelevant. They're just filler for atmosphere. Although the atmosphere presented was intense it over stayed its welcome. I don't regret watching this movie but I would not recommend it and will never watch it again. It did however make me feel like the concept might be nice to see if better executed in a shorter movie. If you chose to watch this movie. Just know the entire movie is just how the beginning is. You never really see any actors at all. Just empty rooms with voices. Specifically the children in question.

There are ads currently hyping this film to prepare it for a theatrical release (and if this can find a distributor, anything can), and once audiences realize they've been totally had, it will die the quiet death it deserves. Basically the ""plot"" consists of watching two kids monotonously crawl around an empty house in the dark, with the same group of point-of-view shots endlessly repeated over and over again. There is nothing ""creepy"" or ""horrifying"" about it whatsoever... it's just appallingly empty and pretentious. The film has a running time of 100 minutes, but it appears the filmmaker shot only about 15 or 20 of actual footage and just repeated most of the same shots over and over again during the editing process, ad nauseum. I'm a huge fan of independent and experimental horror films, but this load of excrement doesn't even come close to even fitting that genre, it just insults the intelligence. The reviews here claiming it's frightening have got to be either planted, or if they're not, written by people who must have a scare quotient of -10. The film has been making the rounds on the internet for some time now, and all I can say is I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it - it's seriously not worth the admission price of a dollar. The budget was reportedly $15,000.00... it seriously looks like it was made for less than $25.00. You've been warned.",1,-1,-1

So you're checking IMBD reviews. My answers to those questions are 1) maybe, and 2) kind of. About 45 minutes in, there is a scene that is legitimately scary. Past that, there are a few scenes that are scary as well, but more than scary, the movie is just creepy and disturbing. You can feel reassured that yes, it does ratchet up in intensity.

If you like movies that are ""abstract"" or ""artistic"", where there are many interpretations, and simultaneously they're all correct, yet also none of them are correct, then you should finish the movie. If that doesn't sound interesting, and you prefer movies that provide clear answers, then turn it off.

This movie is not overly concerned about plot, though there are hints of plot in it. It is more concerned with style, and creating a specific dream/nightmare-like feeling.

I would say it is quite effective at accomplishing that, though I ultimately found the movie somewhat unsatisfying. The plot summaries about children in a house with disappearing doors and a monster sounds like the book ""House of Leaves"", which I loved. But there isn't nearly as much plot as in ""House of Leaves"". You barely see any characters, you barely understand any plot.

I can't say that I liked it, though ultimately I think it was a ""good movie"".

The reason I ultimately gave this movie a somewhat positive review is because it gave me something to think about. I read some articles and posts about it afterwards. I read two different articles like ""Skinamarink Ending Explained"", and they both provided very different summaries of the events that happened in the movie, let alone the ending. The movie is very open to interpretation, and I liked that aspect. There were a few scenes and images that are hard to forget. But the movie is also too long and repetitive and boring a lot of the time. I appreciate the movie, and what the creators were trying to accomplish, and I'll be curious to see what the director can do with more than $15,000.",6,0,0

I'm in the latter category. It has the Lynch vibe some of his movies have where it's like a dream/nightmare & either you're down for the ride or not. If not, it's a brutally boring experience. I just wasn't given enough context to be scared. Most of the time I not only had no idea who was talking or whose POV is being presented, but I couldn't understand 70% of the (very minimal) dialogue. I caught most of what was subtitled. I assume there's a reason for the random subtitles, but I'm not smart enough to understand the point of intentionally letting the indecipherable mumbles/grunts/whispers fly. A couple of scenes and some of the ambient sounds added to the overall creepy vibe, but ultimately just didn't instill any sense of dread, fear, or interest. It wasn't a dream/nightmare or a narrative of childhood primal fear of the unknown, it was just a series of poorly lit set shots & ambiguous mumbles.

Only reason I gave this more than one star was because there is a very effective scene involving one of the children in his parents' room, but that's about it.

So I guess he doesn't have time to watch Cops or otherwise figure out how police operate in the real world or how real gangsters handle their business.

Nothing in this movie rings true. It's just a series of dumb and dumber scenes designed to accommodate a bunch of gunfire and martial arts shenanigans.

To be fair, the film looks pretty good. The cinematography is very nice and the actors give it their all.

Here we see Willis, along with Thomas Jane relegated to the role of interesting background character, both do a relatively ok job considering what they have to work with. The plot itself is a rehash of other revenge type films where a lead has a loved one killed them sets out to take revenge on a criminal organisation. Oh and said lead just happens to be a well trained military person.

The problem here is there are huge plot holes everywhere, it literally takes place in small town America in place which is very clean and clearly affluent yet we are led to believe there are armed gangs of drug dealers running around. This same gang require new members to kill innocents as part of their initiation too, yet whilst doing this there are zero people around in the middle of the day on the main high street? Seriously thought this up? Then we learn the local cops (all four of them) know they are selling drugs but turn a blind eye, yet they leave a protection duty because a kid throws something at their patrol car.

And seeing that the movie also had Mike Tyson on the cast list just didn't crank up any expectations to the movie.

But still, I opted to watch the movie, since it also had both Clive Standen and Thomas Jane on the cast list as well. And of course, also because it was a movie that I hadn't already seen helped play a part in making me sit down to watch what writer and director Jared Cohn had to offer.

And color me impressed, ""Vendetta"" was actually a good movie. Sure, the storyline was pretty straight forward, if not actually generic for an action thriller of this kind. But it sure was entertaining.

The movie has Clive Standen in the leading role, and he does carry the movie quite well with his performance. I wish that Thomas Jane would have had a bigger role, both because of his acting skill, but also because his character was one of the more colorful and interesting in the movie. Much can be said about Mike Tyson, but I will admit that he was actually fairly good in the particular role he had in the movie; it wasn't a big role, but he actually nailed it well enough. And I would also say that ""Vendetta"" is one of the better movies for Bruce Willis in a long, long time.

The soundtrack for the movie was just downright bad. I loathe that kind of music, so it stuck out like a sore thumb.

If you enjoy a good old fashioned action packed and fast paced action thriller then writer and director Jared Cohn actually delivers a wholesome movie with this 2022 movie titled ""Vendetta"".

Somehow it has the feel of both. One thing it does have is a miscast actor as the pivotal character in this love triangle between two men and a one woman. Harry Styles showed a lot of potential in his small role in Dunkirk and he is not terrible here at all, but he totally lacks any sort of gravity or depth necessary for this role. He's a novice and it shows. Somehow the film is still interesting despite that. It's a three character film played by six actors in two different time periods, the late 1950's and the early 2000's. The other five all give fine performances of which I appreciated Gina McKee the most. This is very well directed, though it is not exactly an original storyline, but it still has relevancy and it is also a reminder of just how far gay rights have come since those horrid times not that many years ago. This is ultimately a sad story of three people who were never able to have the lives they wanted, most of that society's fault, some their own. There are some good old songs used to great effect here and the whole film has an appropriate mood. It's flawed, but I still admire some of it even if it might be similar to a 1950's forbidden love paperback.",7,0,1

Emma Corrin is basically a more naive and developed version of Michelle Williams's character, both remarkable in each part to be fair.

The whole thing has a sightly deja-vu feeling and is classic to a fault. I guess this explains the bad reviews but, truth is, this is an absolutely fine film. It certainly didn't deserve all the hate especially compared to that other and really terrible Harry Styles vehicule. Here his soft spoken acting perfectly fits the blunt straightforwardly straight character. The harsh selfishness of youngTom is the most fascinating and refreshing element of the film.

My Policeman uses the traditional biographic structure of back and forth timelines to great results. The idealism of the 50s sequences full of gorgeous arts, elegant flats, cosy countryside and rapturous love is in stark contrast with the gloomy grey suburban present days. It is true than the movie would have benefited from a more balanced use of the present time rather than just being the obvious reminder of a world of redemption and social progress.

There were times where his emotions came across as disingenuous and flat, but also times where I could tell that he's been working on his chops. Now, not knowing what I was going into, I must say I was quite surprised at some of the moments in this movie. There were a couple of things I wish they had conveyed better, such as the time between the 50s and 90s. I felt like there was big gap missing and I was left wondering what happened or how they lived their lives out between those years. I would recommend this to most of my friends, although I know some would cringe at the ""love making"" scenes. I, personally, was not put off by this and found it quite romantic at times, although Patrick did come across as pushy and off putting many times, almost creep like.

It makes Brighton look gorgeous, and it peers into the lives of teacher Marion, policeman Tom, and museum curator Patrick with an appealing non-judgmentalism. You can pick at it: Why does the latter-day Tom treat Patrick like that, and how much does Marion know and when does she know it, and why don't we find out more about Marion's BFF, and the 1999 sequences aren't as rooted in 1999 as the 1957 sequences are in 1957.

332,332,My Policeman,6.5,Drama Romance,21-Oct-22,the past is always present,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is one of those prestige movies that simply isn't as important as it portends to be. That doesn't mean it's unwatchable, only that it lacks the emotional weight and depth to which it strives. Director Michael Grandage (GENIUS, 2016) is working from a script that Ron Nyswaner (PHILADELPHIA, 1993) adapted from the 2012 book by Bethan Roberts ... itself inspired by the true story of writer EM Forster.

The film employs a familiar structure, alternating between the 1950s and 1990s, utilizing two sets of actors playing three main characters. Pop star Harry Styles and his handsome face and lush head of hair plays young police officer Tom, who one day at the beach is introduced to the lovely and educated Marion (Emma Corrin, Lady Di in ""The Crown""). The two begin spending a good deal of time together with Tom being the perfect 'gentleman', even after an extended courtship. He introduces art-loving Marion to his friend Patrick (David Dawson, ALL THE OLD KNIVES, 2022), a museum curator who has many common interests with Marion ... including that of Tom.

The decades-later episodes find Marion (Gina McKee, IN THE LOOP, 2009) inviting stroke victim Patrick (Rupert Everett) to convalesce at the seaside village home she shares with long-time husband Tom (Linus Roche, BATMAN BEGINS, 2005). What we learn is that Marion has done so out of guilt and Tom is not happy with her for doing so, and completely avoids his long-ago friend by taking an inordinate number of walks with his dog along the shoreline. If the two time periods aren't enough for us to understand these relationships, older Marion begins reading Patrick's diaries from those past years and learns the details of what she suspected all along. This cruel invasion of privacy goes far beyond the doubts her younger self had when she saw the portrait of Tom that Patrick drew, or the time Patrick hired Tom as an assistant on art excursion to Venice.

The film opens with Dean Martin crooning his classic, ""Memories are Made of This"", and while it may be an obvious precursor to what we are to watch, it's always a pleasure to hear Dean on a modern sound system. The three characters navigate (quite poorly actually) a messy taboo triangle of love, passion, and deceit, making for a mostly sad story from all angles. It may stress the 1950's attitudes toward sexual preferences, but mostly it shows how the past is always present ... always hovering, even over once-close friendships and loves.

A sensitive film, which investigates the meaning of love and navigates the scenarios of intolerance in the 1950s, but finds problems in taking the audience to the deepest layers of history.

This may be due to a difficulty in disconnecting the image of who Harry Styles is from the character, or because at times the differences between the young cast and the adult cast are excessive.

Directed by Michael Grandage, this 2022 film goes back and forth between the 1950's and the 1990's with two trios of actors playing the same characters in the inevitable love triangle. The drabness of the reflective later scenes is offset by fine work from Gina McKee whose younger self is played affectingly by Emma Corrin (Princess Di in Sesson 4 of ""The Crown""). In an underused role, Linus Roache plays Styles' older self, an ironic choice given Roache's more accomplished performance of a similar character to Styles' thirty years earlier in ""Priest"".

I feel one of the main male characters simply should have been played by someone else because he couldn't pull off the profound intensity needed for this particular story. I won't mention which one, but you'll figure it out.

It's emotive, which is good.

But, I feel like the forbidden (at the time) situation is overwhelming present throughout in a way that's sort of aggravating. I would have enjoyed some extension of the rest of what these characters were all about, because only one facet of their lives was the focal point. A mistake many stories make.

Young Tom, (Harry Styles), is a hunky, rookie policeman; young Marion, (Emma Corrin), is a teacher; young Patrick, (David Dawson), Tom's lover, is a museum curator. The camera loves certain people; Harry Styles is one of those people. He played Tom with a disarming innocence.

The story time jumps between 1999 - 2000, when the Tom and Marion are retired and Marion takes Patrick in to help him heal after he had a stroke, and 1957 - 1958 when the three meet.

It is set in two eras and using basic mathematics one is the late 20th C and the other is the late 1950's. A young woman falls for a policeman and marries him, but there is also a man who falls for him. The film fluctuates between the two eras and Brighton and its nearby coastline are the settings. Out of this entanglement we see a society filled with homophobia and cruelty, both physically and mentally. One scene set in prison and a vicious attack on a gay man appalled me and thankfully the UK has moved on. I tried to believe in the relationships but found the plodding direction boring and well-meaning, trying too hard to convince the audience that love is love despite the BIG subject of same sex orientation.

Quite a thought provoking film contrasting how homosexuals were thought of and treated mid 20th century with present day. The story is told through Marian reading Patrick's diaries of the 1950s. Both she and he love Tom (My Policeman). If I have any criticism it would be that I felt Tom's perspective of having the love of 2 people and how this affected him was not depicted.

As a young queer person, this film meant a lot to me as it helped me understand more what older generations went through to get us to where we are today and why it is crucial that we don't let it go back to how it was. I'm glad so many younger people will get to see this film and understand how, while it still isn't perfect, we (in the UK) live in a much better place than those in the 50s.

347,347,My Policeman,6.5,Drama Romance,12-Nov-22,A triangle that transcends time,"Summary

Director Michael Grandage develops the story with sobriety, fluency and delicacy, but at the same time, without concessions and without the false modesty typical of a certain oily quality English cinema, supported by an outstanding leading sextet. A film that is also very relevant a few days before the World Cup is held in a country like Qatar, which in the middle of 2022 criminally represses homosexuality, like the England of the 50s where most of the story takes place.

Review

In the 90s, Marion welcomes Patrick in her Brighton home to take care of him after he suffered a stroke, without much support from Marion's husband, Tom. Why does she make that decision? The film proposes a trip to the past of the three to elucidate the question.

And that past takes place in Brighton in the 1950s, where Marion, a young teacher, begins an affair with Tom, a policeman, and the young couple bonds with Patrick, the curator of the fine arts museum in the seaside resort, a young gay who must live his homosexuality clandestinely, at a time when it was penalized with jail in England.

Interestingly, some have criticized the ""predictability"" of the triangle made up of the three characters, when the merit of the film does not lie in the suspense in this regard, but in showing how the three process their links and how the time and context condition their reactions. And their behaviors. And in confirming, at the same time, that there are reactions and behaviors that are beyond the times and that perhaps seek to transcend them.

Director Michael Grandage develops the story with sobriety, fluency and delicacy, but at the same time, without concessions or false modesty, as shown by some of the film's erotic scenes. On the other hand, the handling of the timelines is very successful, with revelations that shed new light on the story and the characters. We are not looking at qualité English cinema, but rather a story that moves, with characters who speak justly and who say a lot with their gestures, their looks and their silences.

The leading sextet is made up of Emma Corrin (Lady Di in The Crown 4) as Marion, Harry Styles as Tom and David Dawson as Patrick and Gina McKee, Linus Roache and Rupert Everett (all a nod to that quality English cinema brand Ivory/ Forster) in its mature versions, the performance of the first four being outstanding.

Lastly, I loved the ending and it made me cry unexpectedly with happy tears. I watched the film with my wife and we wept together - usually when she cries I don't - when I cry she doesn't.

Usually tears from films & tv are brought on by tragedies & sadness. My Policeman is a very refreshing & thought provoking film. When it ended, I laid by my wife's side, holding hands, while watching the credits. And we talked & I thought what a beautiful story.",8,1,1
350,350,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,22-Jul-22,"Good, but still misses a mark....","6.7/10

While ""Nope"" is a visual spectacle I found that it didn't sit as well as I would've hoped when it came to the story. However, it still manages to reach its goal of entertaining on some level.

The film felt slightly long due to the first and third acts feeling fast and somewhat stuffed with a lot of goings ons while the second act felt very slow and drawn out. The long parts put me into a state of boredom, and even further than that, once the reveal of the antagonist happened, the magic and tension disappeared. Before that tension disappeared I found there was some good tension built up due to the soundtrack, but again, things fell short.

As for the horror parts, I assumed there would be more than just the ones shown in the commercial, and while there was, again a lot of the horror/magic disappeared once the antagonist was shown.

I did find the acting to be very engaging. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer each brought great energy to their roles, and the supporting actors were equally enjoyable.

Overall, a decent film, but if I could go back I would wait to see it on a cheap night. Acting was enjoyable, the cinematography was spectacular, but the story, the length of the film, and the antagonist weren't up to the par I was expecting.

Thank you for reading my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",6,0,0
351,351,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,25-Aug-22,Seriously disappointing.,"There is no easy way to put this subtly. This movie is boring. It's about 40 minutes too long. The first hour i was wondering when something was going to happen. The swcond hour I was wondering when it would end.

Any attempts at humour fell flat. The acting was just wooden for the most part. The story could of been good but it was just dragged along.

I really struggle to find anything good to say about it. In retrospect I'd of been better of watching ""Get Out"" or ""Us"" again. They are great movies. This is not even close to those standards.

Seriously not recommended. Not even just to watch once. It's over 2 hours and could of been covered in an hour or less.",2,-1,-1
352,352,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,25-Jul-22,Not Sure Where Jordan Was Going,"I hope we are not about to see the Shyamalan effect with Jordan Peele, where the debut film is amazing and everything that follows leaves you scratching your head. I feel like I'm on that road with Peele's body of silver screen work. ""Get Out"" was a masterpiece, while ""Us"" jus didn't do it for me and now ""Nope!""

Keke Palmer did her thing in the role she played (she is the star of this movie for sure) and Daniel kept up with a good performance in his own right, but the film itself was something outta the Twilight Zone. More of a sci-fi thriller than a horror flick, it had too many holes and unanswered questions for my liking. Peele's approach to filmmaking is amazing, much like Shyamalan, but the stories, like Shyamalan's are starting to fall short of being good films.

Jordan may have dreamt this story and woke up at 5am and jotted down every detail he could remember. And like our weird dreams, they never make any sense and we forget a lot of the details by the time we wake up! Nope was like one of those weird a... dreams!",6,0,0
353,353,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,30-Aug-22,Too bad...,"I know Jordan Peele wants to write, direct and produce his own movies and appear like a genius but the writing is horrible here. If he keeps doing this he will end up like Spike Lee, making long movies with lame dialogs that go nowhere.

Some of it is just so over the top and some too unrealistic, like the guy they bought the security system from. He was the only cashier in the store and ends up taking a van to do the install at the ranch himself, then he shows pictures of his girlfriend and talks about his life to the customer. Oh and the same guy also remotely monitors the cameras. WHAT?

Keke Palmer over acts every scene she's in. It was annoying. Daniel Kaluuya has this look on his face like he smelled somebody's fart at all times. Oh and there is zero siblings chemistry between the two of them and they do not look like siblings, not even by a thousand miles.

The acting in this movie is really bad except Steven Yeun, and even the blood looks fake. The attempts at creating tension fail, the attempts at providing humor fail.

I was a big fan of Get Out and Us, but Jordan Peele needs to take a break and think about his movie making.",1,-1,-1
354,354,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,23-Jul-22,Captivating but going to be a divisive experience,"The biggest praise I can give is the cinematography and camera work. I really enjoy looking at wide shots of landscapes and the slow or sudden movements of the camera pushing the tension and anxiety of the scene without having to rely on dialogue or even any acting.

I think the film will be divisive among its audience though. I think this is due to a couple of reasons. First, the story progression feels confusing at times to what we are used to seeing in a thriller or horror. I think labelling it as horror will automatically steer away some people while those that enjoys horror may be disappointed that it lacks enough scares to be called a horror. The trailer I feel also gives away too much and puts the film in a box that might detract viewers. Ultimately, you really have to be open-minded going to this movie. In respect to the genre, Nope really isn't a horror, but more of a blend of some sci-fi, some mystery, some comedy, and luckily, no romance.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. I think for movie lovers this will generally be a good experience. Peele seem to focus more on our shared love for films more than sticking to a particular formula of a single genre. There are many small things you'll enjoy if you already love movies, but it will probably have a visibly different experience to a casual movie goer.

The themes of the film is also a good one, I feel. It feels like a cautionary modern fairy tale and the somewhat real dangers of chasing fame and disrespecting nature.

Jordan Peele is shaping out to be a director whose name alone will generate an audience and I would put Nope as a more captivating experience than Us, and around the same level as Get Out despite being two very different stories. His vision and creativity continues to remain highly interesting and I'm so curious to find out what he goes to work on next!",8,1,1
355,355,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,17-Aug-22,Symbolism is flying over all of your heads,"The amount of reviews calling this pointless and terrible clearly didn't read much into what happens here. Peele is pointing a mirror up to you and the most ironic part is a lot of don't even seem to notice. No, this isn't a typical horror movie. It's more of a Spielbergian blockbuster satire with some amusing moments sprinkled throughout. The ""entity"" is creative and can be quite terrifying. The cinematography is top notch and probably the standout feature of the film, while Kaluuya can say an immense amount without even speaking a word. The screenplay is odd to say the least, but it hits more than it misses.

While I still think this is a lesser film than Get Out or Us and it ran a little too long, you have to commend its originality in a summer sea of IP-based films. Peele attempts something profound and unique here, which should be respected regardless of your thoughts on the film.",8,0,1
356,356,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,07-Aug-22,compared to is other work this one was real bad,"Its not the actors because they are all excellent. I guess its the plot of the movie and how slow it is to start or get going.

From the first 10 minutes i thought it would be a good movie but after 30 minutes it went downhill fast and the ending was even worst.",2,-1,-1
357,357,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,23-Jul-22,"Nope, it doesn't flow like the others, but still has that Peele twist","LIKES:

The Comedy At Times: Peele knows how to put comedy into his work and often to maximize the laughs. He does this very well again, using so little to accomplish so much without trying. His skits with Keele showed putting a lot of energy, but for Nope, the comedy is much more controlled, dropped in at the right times to try and offset the tension. Peele manages to put a lot of fun into the writing from the blunt delivery of Kaluuya's lines to the energetic come get some of Palmer's character Em, it just comes off natural and is not too wedged in to get in the way of the movie. It's also sprinkled nicely throughout the movie, and finding the right time to spice up the moment.

The Pace Mostly: For a movie that promised to be elevated horror and potentially very deep, the pacing was decent for this writer. Nope starts out the same style of Peele's work, taking lots of time set up the pieces and give you inklings of how everyone will be connected. Then as the events start to happen, he manages to ramp things up and start focusing on uncovering elements, all while still focusing on that character development. It's the intrigue that pulled me in, trying to see what the next the level to the story was all while trying to discover the twist he had in store. The pace continued to be like that for much of the film, until right about the end where things changed, but for about 75% of the movie, the pace was thrilling for this horror movie.

The Twist: Peele has always found a way to put his shocking imagination to the works and really keep you guessing as to what the spin to the story will be. Once again, he does not fail to deliver, bringing with it elevated levels of viewing the world and clever symbolism to show the state of the world. His use famous verses and quotes, mixed with subtle signs and visual aids, all work to be that level of poetic disposition he does so well, allowing one to interpret the message to their liking. And yet, for those who just want straight gimmicks and entertainment, Peele is there to give you an odd change to formula that may or may not be impressive to you. For me, he again uses it well and gives the science fiction genre a nice refresh that has plenty to offer the horror element, some shots he used very well to display it. That thrill part really makes the story take a new element and the way he integrates in the odd manner at the end.

The Horror Elements/Tension: Now we are getting to the stuff most care about for the genre, and in this film the horror elements are certainly creative and well done at times. Nope works on several levels to give you the chills experience, starting with the odd and offset, where just enough hints are given to bait you, but have not given everything away. They then start adding tension to the mix, using elements to build up the moment with use of shadows, the feeling of abandonment and the use of shadows. Soon, crazy things start getting immersed into the movie, and the sickening elements bleed in, nods to the classic horror movies, as the disturbing visuals get their moment creep you out. Finally, the tension at the end as the whole finale hits, gives you that intensity to help maintain the edge, but drops the horror element for something else. Again, there is a wicked nature to the whole thing that darker beings will love to watch.

The Acting: You've heard it from many, but no surprise, Nope has an A game of cast to bring this movie to life. Once more, all the cast hits their shining moment and brings that intricacy that the film needs to make sure it comes off creepy. For the big three though we have a few more words to say. Perea is the guy who is the blend of both characters, the sort of comedic support a film needs to help offset the horror. He's a fun character to dive into and certainly makes for an entertaining lead with plenty of jokes to throw into the fire. However, the two leads are the brother and sister duo of OJ and Em, and the group who portray them. Palmer is energetic, bringing sass and fire that is trying to bring the ranch to modern times and challenge the threat at hand. She's the visionary of the group, and her energy livens up the rather serious tone without shattering the believability or elements of the story. It really works and she executes it so well that you can't help but get pulled into all the traits she brings. As for Kaluuya, he transitions well into the modern cowboy roles and I was very impressed with how much he was able to do with so few words spoken. There is just something in his performance and mannerisms that works so well, and I was very happy to see how Peele used his talents to really make the simplistic character layered in comedy, story, and just plain laughs.

The Cinematography: By far, my favorite was the cinematography and the sound that went with it. Nope is all about the right shot to get the moment perfectly terrifying and Peele's team did it beautifully in bringing the odd encounter to life. Shadows as mentioned earlier are deceptive and haunting, leaving you feeling isolated, but yet watched. The angles of the saucer attack grip you into the experience and find a way to make the whole ordeal as gruesome and terrifying as you expect. Even the emotional moments has all the right direction to them and I felt the presence of every moment in the presentation they brought us. Thrown in great sound elements to back it up, or lack of it some cases, and Nope's technical aspect achieves great thing for this reviewer to make it worthwhile to visit in theaters.

DISLIKES:

Plot Holes/Underused Elements: I agree with other reviewers that Peele's plot seemed a little less put together as some of his other works. Nope holds a lot of elements to it, but in terms of complete character story, full on challenges, and even answers to some brimming questions the movie does not quite wrap things up as neatly as he does. The random film element tie in for one character is certainly interesting, but is this awkward tangent that is more a symbolic poke at something and could have been left out. A legendary camera man seems to have a lot prowess and logic, but then things happen to counter that, subtle hints being seen that don't quite make sense and seem a bit hurried. Even Angel's background is sort of like a stoner secondary character that would have been nice to flesh out. All in all, these elements are present enough to get you thinking and serve as the sword slash to modern day culture, but don't quite fit as nicely together like other parts of his movies.

Cross the Line a Little On One my elements: I can't really say much without ruining a twist, but there is a bit of animal cruelty in this movie that is not my particular taste. As human as many productions are, there are some portrayals that I'm just not a fan of watching and Peele sometimes cross the line for me. I have to give him props for keeping it relevant, but there were other moments I would have preferred not to see.

A Few Random Elements That Seemed Jammed In: This has to do with the ending where a lot of things happen very quickly in the climactic finale. Particularly the introduction of a random character whose name holds the symbolic nature, the smoothness of the final moment is mediocre for this reviewer. These elements may have held more shine in the poke fun at modern times role, however story wise seemed out of place and less useful than just adding more to the other characters we were already invested in. Sure, Peele does have some set up to help out and throw real world logic into it, but it just did not seem useful given what was about to happen.

The Pacing: As mentioned, the pace is definitely interesting for about 70-75% of the film, but that other part is a little up and down for me. Watching it unfold at times, the movie drags a bit, going down this element that is supposed to mean something big, but again barely fits into the ordeal they are crafting. Meanwhile, the ending seems very rushed, with things happening that just don't make sense nor have the tie ups I like to see in his work. There are ""changes"" that happen to the characters, but they are so sudden with only tidbits of dialogue to support them that you wonder a bit more why they did what they did. Watching breakdowns from the artistic point works, but as for story elements it's a bit disappointing for the average viewer.

The Verdict:

Nope is a movie with an interesting name, and like most of Peele's work an interesting premise for both artistic sakes and horror sakes. He finds a way to merge the three worlds of mystery, horror, and sci-fi into this layered film, that is pretentious, but still holds entertaining elements that we like to see. Great acting, a deep story, horror elements that take advantage of so many things, alongside supreme visuals are the keys to what makes this movie hold a lot of bite. It's weird, it's convoluted, and yet it works if you can get onboard with his trippy thriller work from the past. However, the movie is not my favorite of the bunch and does not quite get the smoothness that I've seen in the past of this film. It's rushed at times, boring at others, with a story element running tangent that does not quite mesh as well as other origin elements of previous works. Still, it's a fun movie with a few moments worth rewatching, and for those enjoying symbolic takes of the times, worth even more views to dissect all Peele has crammed into the film. Definitely worth a trip to the movies for this one, and I encourage you to take a moment and view it where you can.

My scores are:

Horror/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0.",8,1,1
358,358,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,26-Aug-22,"Very ambitious and original, with some great metaphors, but ultimately could've been so much better.","It's Peele's best entry to date - imo, but it tries - as usual, to be too sophisticated, a conversation piece, moreso than an enjoyable thrilling ride. It felt too long, too slow, muddled, with a convoluted and disjointed narrative that was all over the place. Any character or plot development was merely metaphorical and lacked depth and cohesion. The cinematography and visual effects were excellent, as were the performances, although I'm getting tired of Kaluuya's monotonic and drab demeanor. His character could've been better cast with someone who'd be excited to star in this film, just like Palmer was.",7,1,1
359,359,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,21-Jul-22,A drastically different Jordan Peele film from feel and scope,"Jordan Peele's return to the big screen is a tremendous, refreshing change of pace to the recent Hollywood flops and disappointments the recent MCU films have been.

Jordan Peele is in top form with his recent film Nope. I am very pleasantly surprised with how well done this was and how much I enjoyed this film. I had no doubt with Jordan Peele he would do something good but he has set a new bar in the psychological, thriller, horror genre.

I don't know where to start as I have so many thoughts racing through my brain, so I'll start simple. Great cinematography this film was beautiful and looked great on the IMAX screen. Great writing and I have to stop to say the writing in this film is superior to the writing in Get Out and Us. Jordan Peele's writing talent has come a long way since those films. The dialogue and chemistry between actors and characters was so organic, it just felt so natural and nothing feeling forced. Speaking of things not feeling forced the comedy and jokes, all do so well and don't detract from the serious tone of the film.

Which will lead me to great acting. Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea, and Steven Yeun (just to name a few of the films stars) all give tremendous performances. It was so great to see Steven Yeun as I haven't seen him in anything since he starred as Glenn Rhee in The Walking Dead. Amazing sound design and sound effects, it truly brought the tension and horror to tremendous heights it had me on the edge of my sit.

Now I want to discuss the viewing experience as it has been a long time since a horror film truly had an impact on me. Some genuinely terrifying moments that like I said had me on the edge of my seat. I am not easily scared and jump scares I find them to be cheap and weak but there were some scares here that genuinely made me jump. At one moment I found myself saying ""nope, not today Satan"" I'm sure there will be a lot of ""nope"" remarks from audience members. But is this worth the IMAX screen? To that question I'd say yes and no. This film did not make much use of IMAX cameras which throughout the film made me question why is it in IMAX? But I have to say when the IMAX sequences finally came along it was great. The utilization of the IMAX cameras in certain scenes made for a great pay off and of course coupled with the great IMAX sound it heightened the viewing experience. But I can't say it was a must watch in IMAX. To steer away from spoilers I will simply say a teaser trailer for a certain upcoming film from my favorite director made watching it in IMAX well worth it.

I'll start wrapping this up as I'm sure some people who saw the amount of text in this review thought ""nope, I'm not reading all that"" no pun intended. The only real downside of this film for me was it did lose a little steam in the conclusion and I didn't feel satisfied nor unsatisfied. I still have a lot of questions and would like some more information but perhaps these questions are answered in the film and I missed them. I definitely plan on multiple viewings of this film.

This is my new favorite Jordan Peele film, better than his recent film Us and right up there with Get Out while surpassing it. I would rate this film between a 8.5 or 8.9 but because I don't like half scores I'm going to give it the full 9 because of how this film at moments genuinely had me jumping. It was a fun, exciting, thrill ride from start to finish. I look forward to whatever comes next from Jordan Peele.

I also see a lot of it as a smart twist on the horror genre. Whereas a lot of filmmakers create horror movies where the main characters survive despite their stupidity, this one plays on the main characters actually being clever enough to ""nope out."" Finally, our years of yelling ""don't go in the closet/basement/outside, you idiot!"" at the movie screen have been answered.

Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya are terrific as the stars. The cinematography is on point. This whole movie is beautifully shot with a lot of subplots and recurring themes that will leave a lot of room for interpretation and after-movie discussion.

Also, not sure why it's being called a horror movie, there is little to no suspense, let alone horror. The most ""horror"" part ends up not even being real. Skip this, it's just bad and boring. Not even a crazy twisty psychological ending, one thing that Peele is known and (was) praised for. Not sure what the hell happened in the writer's room with this one. A true shame. Damn.

This time's no different.

The good; excellent photography work and really good acting performances. The build up in suspense during the first hour is magnificent, but...

The bad; in the second hour of the movie the UFO's become visible and the suspense and thrill deteriorate quite badly. Such a pity.

The INvisibility of the UFO""s in the first hour is much more thrilling and spooky, because it makes me wonder WHAT THE HECK is going on.

366,366,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,27-Jul-22,A breath of fresh air in evermore stale big Hollywood,"As ""Nope"" (2022 release; 135 min.) opens, we are on the Haywood Hollywood Horses farm, the only black-owned horses training camp for movies and TV. One day, small things start falling out of the sky and Otis Sr., who runs the farm, is struck and killed. His kids OJ and EM try to carry on the farm... At this pint we are 10 min into the film.

Couple of comments: this is the 3rd film from writer-producer-director Jordan Peele, after the brilliant ""Get Out"" and the okay but uneven ""Us"". With ""Nope"", Peele goes on a much bigger scale and along the way brings us a sci-fi mystery movie. The lesser said about the plot, the better so as not to spoil anything. Just watch! In the bigger picture. Big Hollywood has become so extremely risk adverse that if a movie isn't Marvel or DC Comic-related, or otherwise a sequel or prequel or spin-off or other franchise-related property, chances are the movie won't be made. In other words, big Hollywood as much as possible avoids an ORIGINAL idea, and as a result truly original amazing movies like Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"" become ever rarer. This makes ""Nope"" truly a breath of fresh air in today's stale Hollywood climate. Big budget, big idea, above all, ORIGINAL. Does that make it a perfect movie? Nope, it does not. But at least Peele tries. Daniel Kaluuya as OJ is tops, yet again. Apparently there is already talk of a sequel. To which I say, NOPE! I am crossing my fingers that Peel's next film will be something completely different altogether from what he has done to date, as long as it's original. No sequel, please!

""Nope"" opened in theaters last weekend and I saw it here in Cincinnati just the other night. The Tuesday evening discount screening was pretty much a sell-out. If you are in the mood for an original sci-fi mystery, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",7,1,1
367,367,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,21-Jul-22,Nope is the movie of the Summer,"""Nope,"" is one of the most anticipated releases of the summer, with its cryptic trailer promising another genre-bending, politically charged thriller from Peele, albeit one that includes UFOs. The film, which stars Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as a brother and sister who run Hollywood's only Black-owned horse ranch, has prompted plenty of speculation from cinephiles about its UFO plotlines. It's surprising how little information about writer/director Jordan Peele's ""Nope"" has leaked since it was first announced. There have been a few trailers that show what may or may not be the film's primary threat, and the marketing team has done a very good job with posters of its main cast members looking up at the sky and uttering the film's title. All that thirst for capitalistic box office gain comes with a price, namely that it builds hype and an audience expectation that may not be met once the finished product is unveiled. After the massively entertaining, Oscar-winning calling card of ""Get Out,"" Jordan Peele moved toward a hybrid of audience pleaser and filmmaker's jones with ""Us."" That film was less blatant and required more work on the audience's part, which made it fascinating for some and frustrating for others. It was also powered by a career-best performance by Lupita Nyong'o, whose dual role was unshakably strange and multilayered. There is no equivalent performance in ""Nope"" to anchor viewers, and it's about three times as messy. The rest of the cast features Steven Yuen as Jupe, a barker who runs an alien-based carnival of sorts out in the same middle of nowhere the Haywoods have their ranch, and Angel (Brandon Perea), a techie specializing in surveillance equipment he sells out of a Best Buy clone called ""Ray's."" ""Nope"" is not as good as ""Get Out"" or ""Us,"" but it's definitely Peele's creepiest movie. He's always been more Rod Serling than Rob Zombie, and that's most evident here. There's humor to be had in the minority characters' reactions to horror (yes, they say ""nope"" the way most people would say ""oh HELL NAW!""), but the director really leans into Hitchcock's tenet about suspense vs. Surprise. The wait for something awful to happen is always worse than when it does. Peele also gets good performances out of Kaluuya and Palmer, who believably work the sibling angle with all its longstanding grudges, in-jokes and patterns based on who's older. Wincott wields his wonderful voice as a force of nature. Yuen seems to be off-kilter and the movie's weak link, but the more I thought about his plotline, the more his performance made sense. I think he's the film's biggest breadcrumb in terms of figuring it all out. As for the special effects, they're interesting, to say the least.",10,1,1

370,370,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,15-Dec-22,Nope,"Jordan Peele's Nope has been compared to a Spielberg extravaganza such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Conceptually it is closer to M Night Shyamalan. With a central premise about fame.

Some of the characters have been involved in the tv and film industry. Others are chasing fame such as news and reality tv.

OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is a rancher and horse wrangler. Together with his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) they need to do something about their struggling business after the sudden death of their father who was hit by some falling debris.

There are the strange death of their horses. They have had to sell some horses to their neighbour Ricky 'Jupe' Park (Steven Yeun) a former child actor who now operates a Western theme park.

The possibility of UFO activity out there could be the sibling's salvation. Hoping to recapture footage of the impossible could be a way to make a fortune.

Like a Shyamalan movie, Nope is told in a leisurely pace like some modern western before the horror/sci fi part cranks up.

It is not without flaws. I am bemused why Emerald sounds like some person who grew up in the hood. It is jarring.

When the alien attacks takes place, there is a lack of law enforcement, army and media activity.

Jupe's past as a child actor where a chimpanzee went on a rampage sits oddly. It was like walking into a David Lynch film.

Nope is odd, stilted and strangely beguiling. It is hard to overlook the flaws.",5,-1,0

Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer are a perfect match. Palmer's boundless energy and charm smartly contrasted by Kaluuya's more reserved presence and combined they're family dynamic feels as real as possible. Brandon Perea and Michael Wincott are great additions who add some really solid dry wit.

Jordan Peele's direction is incredible, he's in full control of the increased scale and with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, utilises the IMAX format to it's best. The deliberately methodical camera work helps to make the spectacle feel grand and comprehensible.

As a thriller, the film delivers plenty of moments of genuine fear with nail biting tension. The music by Michael Ables is amazing, it doesn't sound like the average sci-fi film and instead has a more awe inspiring and epic feel that has some really triumphant moments.",10,1,1

373,373,Nope,6.8,Horror Mystery Sci-Fi,11-Aug-22,A strange yet undeniably original experience from beginning to end,"""Nope"" is a sci-fi horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele (""Get Out"", ""Us""). Starring Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Steven Yeun, it is a strange yet undeniably original experience from beginning to end that is sure to polarise audiences right down the middle.

In California, siblings Otis ""OJ"" Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald ""Em"" Haywood (Keke Palmer) inherit their father's (Keith David) ranch for media productions shortly after his untimely death. The two siblings struggle to keep the ranch in business due to their conflicting interests, with OJ hoping to continue his father's legacy working on the farm while Em desires to become famous in Hollywood. One night, the electricity surrounding the ranch keeps repeatedly cutting out and the pair are soon shocked to discover that their horses have also seemingly vanished into thin air. Hoping to get to the bottom of this mystery, the siblings come up with a plan to capture video evidence of whatever is causing these bizarre disturbances, enlisting the help of local tech salesman Angel Torres (Brandon Perea) and cameraman Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott).

After making his directorial debut in 2017 with ""Get Out"" and following up with ""Us"" two years later, Jordan Peele has risen above the ranks to become one of the most interesting filmmakers working in Hollywood today. His unique view of the world has helped separate him from most other directors who are merely piggybacking off the success of nostalgia and other things that are currently trending. If anything, Peele's work feels like an appropriate antidote for those who are overwhelmed with the plethora of reboots, remakes, and sequels that only exist to make a quick buck for the major studios. It seems that Peele is now three for three because his third film ""Nope"" is yet another film benefitting greatly from his creativity, whether audiences like that kind of thing or not.

To put it bluntly, this is not the type of film that is easily accessible to just anyone. As mentioned above, Jordan Peele is the type of filmmaker who relies primarily on his own perspective of things, with little outside influence over what kind of story he is trying to tell. Because of that, it is difficult to pitch this movie as something for a mainstream audience. There were so many moments that had a seasoned viewer like myself trying to figure out which particular story elements would be expanded upon later or were just there as a red herring to waste our time. Although I did find enjoyment in deducing what was relevant and what wasn't, I cannot say I speak for everyone else. I can only imagine how much of a chore it would be for some viewers out there who simply want to watch a movie without the need to process all this information being thrown at them. That's not to say the film is hard to follow, it's just that there may be too much to take in at once, which will likely necessitate a second viewing.

Much like in his previous two films, Peele has proven he has the most important talent a horror-themed director needs in order to be successful - the ability to create and sustain suspense. To create a suspenseful scene is one thing, but to prolong it for the correct amount of time is a skill very few directors have been able to master, and yet again Peele pulls it off with flying colours. I can't help but admire how Peele manages to weave his audience along during certain scenes for an extended period of time, setting up intriguing situations where things could easily go either way. And when something eventually does happen, whether you predicted it or not, it still arrives with such a sudden impact that it actually feels earned and isn't just a cheap jump scare added for the sake of it. There aren't too many other filmmakers who have been able to do this, but one who definitely comes to mind is the ""Master of Suspense"" himself, Alfred Hitchcock. I find that most other horror directors are too reliant on gory violence for shock value so it is quite refreshing to see a filmmaker like Jordan Peele go against the grain and opt for a more classic approach to building up fear in his viewers. Although the film does have its fair share of violent moments, they aren't intended as the main focus of what the audience should perceive as scary.

In his second collaboration with Peele, Daniel Kaluuya proves he is the director's good luck charm, as his performance fits the film's tone perfectly. If they are able to keep things this good between them, then I forsee a working relationship between Peele and Kaluuya similar to that of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro in the near future. Kaluuya plays into OJ's curiosity and pragmatism with such tenacity that you instantly want him to succeed in finding whoever is responsible for causing all of his problems. He is seen to be both a hard worker and an innovative thinker, which is what allows him to come up with all these clever ideas on how to gain photographic proof of this sustained threat.. Kaluuya also had great chemistry with Keke Palmer as OJ's sister Em, whose sassy personality played off her on-screen brother's more serious demeanour. Though the two don't always agree on what is right for the ranch's future, they share a close enough bond for them to understand that if this danger from the skies continues, each of their futures will be in jeopardy.

Despite their shorter screen time, I think the supporting cast members Steven Yeun, Michael Wincott, and Brandon Perea are worth mentioning as well. Yeun in particular was interesting as Jupe, a former child star who buys a horse from the Haywood siblings, only to become involved in the same problems as them later on. Wincott was also a nice addition to the film as Antlers Holst, a famous cinematographer who agrees to help the siblings to capture on film who or what is causing this strange phenomenon. However, out of the three of them, relative newcomer Brandon Perea surprised me the most as Angel Torres, a tech savvy employee at an electronic store whose products end up playing an instrumental role in the discovery of what is going on. I won't divulge too much more information about them at the risk of posting spoilers so all I will say the film would not have worked half as well if it weren't for the combined efforts of these three.

If you are tired of all the countless unnecessary sequels, obligatorily contracted reboots, or remakes nobody asked for, then a film like ""Nope"" should provide some relief if you crave originality. On that note, if you are put off by non-linear storytelling with some plot devices that lead nowhere, then this might not be your cup of tea. This isn't a film that caters towards everybody's tastes so I can't simply recommend it to just any person. To be fair though, Peele's previous two films elicited a similar response from me as well, which I suppose is a good thing the more I think about it. Any form of art that can provoke such a divided response from audiences has clearly done something right, so for that reason alone I believe the film is a success.

I rate it 8/10.",8,1,1

You don't care what happens to any of the cast. You almost want to see them get messed up just to add some excitement to the movie. Nothing ever really happens. It feels like a film student wanted to make a weird alien movie and this is what they came up with.

It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!

It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.

Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher.

379,379,X,6.6,Horror Mystery Thriller,02-Apr-22,"Nothing new here, but nothing bad either","An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.

381,381,X,6.6,Horror Mystery Thriller,02-Nov-22,A real yawner,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.

It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen.",3,-1,-1
382,382,X,6.6,Horror Mystery Thriller,18-Mar-22,"A Fun, Classically Styled Slasher","Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.

Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.

It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.

If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for.

The good in this movie right off the bat is the performances. Everyone in the movie is great. The standouts here are Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega. These two were great. The movie also has a really strong message about sex and what it really means for these people. It's a very strong message and it works. The gore here is also great.

The sex is not just there to titilate of course (although I was more than surprised to see Brittany Snow show what she is blessed with), no it serves the story and especially one of the many themes we have here. There is a discussion about being young, living life to the fullest or at least to an extent that makes one happy. Before you get old and have too many regrets. Young vs old is something you could say. But the less you know going in, the better you will be able to receive.

The acting is good and not just from the clearly younger people in old age makeup (look at in the credits who is playing the woman if you have not realized it while you were watching). Effects are top notch, though not for the faint hearted ... you cannot be too squeamish.

Obviously inspired by Tobe Hooper's classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), writer-director Ti West ensured that X was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. Where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. Mia Goth's Maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. Bobby-Lynne, played well by Brittany Snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. Jackson (Kid Cudi) is a Vietnam veteran, while Wayne (Martin Henderson) and RJ (Owen Campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. Finishing off the cast, Jenny Ortega plays the outsider of the group, Lorraine.

Lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. However, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. They will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.

From the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. The TV in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. As well as this, a well-crafted shot of Lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. Unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.

This slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. The extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. It seems as if Ti West had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. And while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.

The editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. Alongside this, X lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. The film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.

Without a strong plot, X fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. The killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic. Decently written characters could not make up for some of the bizarre dialogue and while gore was in abundance suspense was not.",4,-1,-1

402,402,Cirkus,4.9,Comedy Drama,23-Dec-22,"Even the wasted scenes of Angoor would make a better film than this. By far, Rohit Shetty's Worst Flick Ever.","Cirkus (2022) : Movie Review -

Rohit Shetty's Cirkus has a big cast that includes Ranveer Singh, Pooja Hegde, Jacqueline Fernandez, Varun Sharma, and many other comedy actors that are loved by audiences, but the show doesn't do justice to the names. William Shakespeare made ""The Comedy of Errors"" in the 16th century and gave the world an immortal formula for crazy entertainment. Bollywood has made ""Ram Aur Shyam,"" ""Seeta Aur Geeta,"" ""Judwaa,"" and countless other films on the same formula of twins. The legendary writer Gulzar made ""Angoor"" on a very small budget and with a not-so-famous cast compared to others and showed them that good content cannot be bought with money. That vision and storytelling cannot be bought, copied, or remade. You have to have it in yourself. Rohit Shetty, who has the most 100-crore grossers for any Bollywood director, was so busy with money spinners that he didn't pay attention to this thing. Cirkus has lavish sets, a big scale, a huge cast, and a big director, but all that goes to waste because it has a tiny content. From writing, screenwriting, performances, music, and direction, Cirkus is the biggest disappointment of the year that nobody expected.

Cirkus is adapted from Angoor but set against a different backdrop. It revolves around a funny doctor's experiment in which two pairs of twin brothers can live separately, with one of them staying with the other. Roy (Ranveer Singh) and Joy (Varun Sharma) are adopted by a rich family in Bengaluru, while the other pair is adopted by a middle-class family and have a circus of their own in Ooty. What happens when one pair of Joy and Roy travel to the town of the other pair is all you get to see in Cirkus. It involves a lot of misunderstandings, relationships, robberies, electric current, and chaos. One of our Roys is married, while the other is about to be married. Naturally, the misunderstanding implicates their love interests too.

Just like the ancient circus, the film Cirkus is damn outdated. Forget Angoor's entire runtime; it does not even match 1/10th of it. Even the last 10 minutes of Charlie Chaplin's cult classic ""Circus"" (1929) are 10 times funnier than this 138-minute loud show. What Farhad Samji, Sanchit Bedre, and Vidhi Ghodgaonkar have written should be sent to the film library to educate people about how not to write a script. The screenplay is even more dumb. A KG student could easily point out mistakes here. Which doctor can have the patience to wait for years to see what his one experiment has done? Didn't he do anything else for years? Having a film based in an outdated era is fine; many writers and filmmakers do it, but what's the need for using outdated execution? Why can't the character be organic and funny? Making cringe faces, busted organs, and shock-giving moments is not enough to make one laugh. Why do you need to use old songs to make our ears bleed? Cirkus is a flop show there.

Talking about performances, it seems that there was a competition among the cast members to see who would do worse. I respect the comedy legends, and I know how difficult it is to act in this genre. I myself had become a topic of hush-hush in school days when I tried a 2-minute stand-up comedy act. Ranveer Singh had a blast last Christmas with 83, delivering his career-best performance, but 2022 has left two black spots on his emerging, illustrious career. Jayeshbhai Jordaar and now Cirkus: Why Ranveer? Why? How on earth can Gully Boy and 83 be followed by these two duds? Pooja Hegde doesn't even try. Radhe Shyam, Beast, Acharya, and now Cirkus-dear Pooja Hegde, you could do a lot better, or should I say you deserved better. In her first verbal dialogue, Jacqueline Fernandez yells, ""Daddy!"" Just one word, and you know the game is over. Even the re-recorded accents of Pran, Jeevan, and Prem Chopra would have sounded better than the original sound that Sanjay Mishra generated. Varun Sharma is there, but you have to remind yourself of that so often. Siddarth Jadhav, Murali Sharma, Mukesh Tiwari, and Brajesh Hirjee have done decently despite badly written characters. Johny Lever is completely wasted. I mean, can you believe it? How can someone waste THE JOHNY LEVER, and that too in a comedy film?! The rest of the cast has nothing impressive either, so why waste a couple of lines?

Cirkus is a high-scale production with good support from the technical team. Current Laga is the only saving grace in the music album, and wouldn't you love Deepika's wild dance steps? The cinematography is neat, the background score keeps you busy, and the locations and sets are eye-pleasing, though some of them look fake and banal. The VFX work didn't provide details on the final output. Cirkus' dialogues might just go down in history books as one of the worst written dialogues for a Rohit Shetty film. ""Main wafadaar hu, Maine aapka Kela khaya hai,"" ""Itte-cock se hua,"" and ""Municipality"" will annoy you. How can Rohit expect us to hear these double-meaning jokes with our families in cinemas? Where are those clean family films by him? Every single laugh is forceful and inessential. What's wrong with Rohit that he got to this level? I never expected this. Yes, I know he's not making those high-repeat value films like ""Golmaal: Fun Unlimited"" and ""Singham"" nowadays, but he was doing fine with those decent entertainments that can be least watched at once. I agree, Bollywood has gone wrong in 2022 and has not made good comedies for over a decade, but nobody expected this kind of fall. Cirkus is a king-sized disheartenment. Who'd expected the last Bollywood release of the year to be so bad and tortuous? At least, not me. The pandemic has affected our lives, and so have filmmakers too. It is clearly visible from the products they have made post pandemic. I hope he roars back with Singham and Golmaal Again.

403,403,Cirkus,4.9,Comedy Drama,24-Dec-22,The worst of Rohit Shetty.,"Cirkus review :

Just when you thought it can't get any worse for Bollywood in 2022, Rohit Shetty comes with his oddly spelt CIRKUS which would definitely rank amongst the worst Hindi movies of this year. Truly. Badly. Deeply. After the excruciating two and half hours inside the dark near empty Citylight theatre at Mahim, my head was reeling at the sheer absurdity of it all and eyes watering from the ultra bright gaudy colour palettes needlessly used in the movie.

Not that I have a problem with loud over the top comedies which till date, were Shetty's fortè. I have liked the Golmaal series (2006 -) and even those standalone All the Best (2009) and Bol Bachchan (2012) he churns out occasionally. But Cirkus is a problem. And the problem is a lacklustre outdated script which fails to engage and entertain you at any point. Trust me, everything about the movie is seen before endured that..

The Comedy of Errors adapted wonderfully by Gulzar as Angoor (1982) is the obvious inspiration here. Ranveer Singh and Varun Sharma step in to the late and great Sanjeev Kumar and Deven Varma's shoes but sadly, cant hold a candle to them. Jacqueline and Pooja Hegde are hopelessly wasted. Rohit Shetty regulars from Golmaal series make their mandatory appearances but still can't evoke any laughter. Yup, there is an exception in form of Marathi actor Siddharth Jadhav who is genuinely funny. Veteran comedian like Johnny Lever is restricted to three scenes only. Sanjay Mishra falls flat imitating the yesteryear villain Jeevan while Murali Sharma does a Kader Khan breaking the fourth wall continously and talking to the audience.

I can go on and on ranting about the film but don't wish to do so just for Rohit and his team. I sincerely believe the talented director has the capability to entertain his audience aplenty. He is truly the present day Manmohan Desai. One particular bad day at work is excused. Better luck next time dude...bring back Singham or Golmaal!!

This harks back to a bad 1980s Bollywood film that were cheap and nasty.

Twins separated at birth is a story done to death in Bollywood but there is no difference in the two characters.

Ranveer overacts to the point that it made me cringe. The supporting cast have very little to support.

Money has been wasted making this and I doubt they will recover their budget let alone make a profit. I think Bollywood need to go back to the drawing board and think of some original ideas that appeal to the much wiser and aware audiences.

405,405,Cirkus,4.9,Comedy Drama,24-Dec-22,Rohit Shetty's Multi-Starrer 'Cirkus' is Really A Cirkus in terms of Entertainment !!!,"A square and B square are the names of the twins, who are later christened as Roy (Ranveer Singh) and Joy (Varun Sharma) by the two different couples, who adopt them. Thus, unknowingly putting in place a recipe for disaster and confusion that is bound to play out when these four boys grow up and bump into each other. That's precisely the one-line story (if we can call it that) of this Rohit Shetty film that's supposed to be a comedy of errors but is abysmally low on that ingredient.

Set in the picturesque green hills of Ooty and carefully created colourful and unreal set pieces that look like a theme park, 'Cirkus' is based in the late 60s or early 70s era, as the film desperately tries to pay a tribute to the cinema of the time. Many classic Bollywood numbers pop up in the background at every given opportunity and the only thing louder than the yesteryear costumes of the actors, is their acting. It's an all-out slapstick comedy but the problem is not that, as Bollywood has seen several films in that genre that have taken the audience along with it for a joyride. It also includes some films from Rohit Shetty's stable.

Collectively, barely a scene or two manage to evoke the kind of laughter we are used to experiencing in a Rohit Shetty film. Sample this, our hero Roy is immune to high voltage shocks and his showstopper act at his 'Jubilee Cirkus' is to dramatically make two live wires kiss each other, with his bare hands. But everytime he does that his judwaa bhai experiences a massive electric shock and so does anyone who touches him. All is well with him once the act is over. If you can get past this, then you'd perhaps have a little less discomfort in sitting through the rest of the plot that involves caricatures, good actors wasted in stereotypical characters, unfunny dialogues, and situations that literally go nowhere. The screenplay offers nothing fresh in terms of comedy and punchlines and suffers from abject repetition.

Ranveer Singh tries to do his best in portraying both his characters, but sadly both the parts lack enough conviction. Deepika Padukone's cameo in the song 'Current Laga Re' is a highlight that comes as a true respite. Varun Sharma's comic timing is criminally wasted here and, in the end, it's upto the ever-so-dependable Johny Lever (as Polson bhai) to bring in some much-needed organic laughter. The ace comedian creates more rib-tickling moments in his few minutes of screentime than the entire cast put together. Pooja Hegde looks resplendent in her sombre role of Roy's wife Mala. Jacqueline Fernandez steps in to add the glam quotient as Roy's girlfriend and does just that. Sanjay Mishra once again takes one for the team in a role that isn't funny, but the actor makes up for the lack in the writing and the missing punchlines, which is a recurring problem of this unfunny mess.

'Cirkus' is a busy film filled with a battery of characters put together with a purpose to make us laugh, but is far from that. Entertaining the audience with slapstick comedy and drama is a tightrope that Rohit Shetty has successfully walked before but this time he seems to have tripped several times along the way.",1,-1,-1

Ranveer for me in this movie another example of overactive and overacting grinded with overconfidence that he will turn this into gold, but not the case.

408,408,Cirkus,4.9,Comedy Drama,23-Dec-22,"Deserves Oscar, Full of Suspense, Comedy, Romance, and Thrill But Underrated","This is the first review I have written so long. Kindly read till the end, it is worth it.

The only thing best about this movie is the song ""Main Nacha Toh Sab Ko Rant Laga Re, Rant Laga, Rant Laga, Rant Laga Re"". I don't know about the actor in the film, I was surely electrified.

How? I'll tell you, just keep reading.

First of all, the movie did a good job in giving a disclaimer at the beginning that ""kindly don't try these stunts"". It really saved many lives in theatre because people were about to smash each other while watching the film out of frustration.

What a fantastic acting done by Ranveer Singh. When he was getting shock, he pulled tongue out. Ranveer Singh was in touch of electricity and the audience was getting shock in the theatre.

The best part about this movie was that it has everything, the suspense, romance, comedy, thrill, and everything. The film has so many suspense that you have to take homeopathic medicine to sharpen your mind and understand it. This movies makes you think that ""what if I had brain?"" So, that is the suspense.

Now, the thrill part is that, by mistake if you listen to the complete dialogues, you will get a heart attack. The scenes were so hilarious that I am still crying after watching them.

In this movie, people are just fighting with each other and then getting shocked, real electricity involved. What in the world did I just watched?

I paid Rs. 200 for the tickets of this movie. This is very low as compared to the content delivered by this movie. This is a masterpiece movie as compared to Heropanti 2.

The film has so many stars, cameo, and talents, I was scared. Varun Sharma did an splendid work. He should be given an Oscar for playing the same type of character and role in this film as well. The upcoming generation of actors will be inspired so much by him. He did a splendid job.

If you are not getting any space to hang out with your partner, or hotel rooms are too much expensive, just go to the theatre to watch this movie ""Cirkus"" because the whole theatre was empty. Only two couples were sitting in front of me and they were not even focusing on the movie, they were doing their own thing.

At the end, I want to say that, it's a complete family entertainer film. You come with your family, buy pop corns, drinks, and next to the ""Cirkus"" movie, there's Avatar 2, go watch it. Because I am in trauma after watching this movie Cirkus. I need to watch Avatar now to cool my stress and mind.

And, one last thing, this movie ""Cirkus"" also has a message that the family audience will also appreciate. The message is that ""keep your family audience away from this movie"". The film is so hilarious that if my parents found that I just watched this movie, they won't allow me inside.

They marketed this movie as a comedy movie. But I challenge you, after watching this movie, if you get a single grin or laugh due to the scenes and dialogues, you can come here and downvote this review. I promise you that.

When it comes to story and plot, there's nothing, literally nothing. When it comes to performance, the 4-5 viewers in the theatre did a good job saving themselves from heart-attacks. They hired legendary stars in this movie, but none of them could deliver the legendary type of performance as they did in their previous movies.

This film is more comedy than my girlfriend. I was laughing so much in every scene that I worried if I would lose my mind. Zero stars, total negative from my side, no story, and third class performance by the actors.

When it comes to ratings, I will not give ratings. I will give blessings, to the ones who go to watch this movie. May you watch the full show and return safely.",1,1,-1

413,413,Cirkus,4.9,Comedy Drama,24-Dec-22,There is a limit to overacting even in slapsticks,"When the genre is slapstick comedy, you step into the theatre expecting overacting. I too did the same. What i witnessed was overacting that was beyond the word overacting!!

Cirkus fails miserably in making you laugh but succeeds brilliantly in making your skin crawl with cringiness. Where do I even start from?

SETS - well, anyone expecting realistic sets from a Rohit Shetty comedy is foolish. We all know rohit Shetty uses artificial colorful sets for his films but in this film, many of the city sets reminded me of the famous Pogo cartoon Noddy sets.

PLOT - while the plot is adapted from comedy of errors , it adds little stuff like experiment and all to tweak some parts. This experiment thing went over my head while rest is all as expected.

COMEDY :-

ok here we go! Only...i repeat...only Sanjay Mishra managed to bring the maximum laughs in this film. Whenever he was there on screen, laughs were guaranteed (even though he has been given lake dialogues). Rest everywhere, comedy was too too over the top even for slapstick standard. Rohit Shetty uses his dated comedy formula of physical (dancing and jumping around) and loud comedy to try making us laugh but this time fails ..first due to lack of novelty and two... overacting beyond the word overacting. The current shock comedy scenes become too cringy after a certain point. The thief (don't know his real name ) named momo was way too irritating to watch and he reaches peak of irritation in a scene after interval in Roy's house sequence. Even a Johnny lever can't make you laugh. Comedy is totally missing from a comedy film only...irony.

DIALOGUES - Bad ! They are so lame and weak that it is just because of Sanjay Mishra 's performance that his lame dialogues sound funny. Someone for god sake sack Farhad Samji from his job . There are much better comedy dialogue writers like Raaj Shandaliya but he barely gets work .

PERFORMANCE - Rohit Shetty uses all his regular go to people in this film and apart from Sanjay Mishra, all fail miserably. Actresses don't have anything to do.

Overall, it's hard to believe this is a Rohit Shetty film. His comedy downfall i could easily feel when i was unimpressed with his Golmaal 4 and now , with this film, Rohit has slipped further down in the comedy line. Oh btw, there is a forced connection put at the end to golmaal 4 (why am I even saying this, it's already shown in the trailer) and i donr know why they want a universe. First make the standalone film properly and then make a universe out of it.",2,-1,-1

It has a weak storyline... They tried hard to make you laugh but they failed.... This might be the worst Rohit Shetty movie...

Talking of Actings, Ranveer acting was average but this role did not suit him... Rakul was average too... Other senior casts like Johnny Lever was good but due to poor story line and dialogues it did not come out upto the mark....

The only good thing about the movie was the locations and beautiful sets.... This is not a movie you want to watch on christmas holidays...",3,-1,-1

This film couldn't justify the calibre of A-list stars like Ranveer Singh, Deepika , Pooja Hegde etc. Veteran actors like Jhonny Lever and Sanjay Mishra could be given more screen time.

Although Cirkus is an adaptation of movie 'Angoor' that starred Sanjeev Kumar and Moushmi Chatarjee. It fails to grasp the comic stance of the 1982 movie. The comic timing and dialogues are sometimes feel cringey if not funny at all.

This could truly be touted as my most frustrating movie going experience ever. I mean what the hell was Mr Shetty thinking while making this film!? He really needs to fire Farhad Samjhi and focus on the plot of his films and enhance his storytelling techniques rather than using the same rehashed jokes and gags from his previous films.

All I would have to say really is that I'm the kind of person that watches everything that is out, and try to go to a movie theater at least thrice a month . But I have sworn off from ever buying a movie ticket for anything produced/directed by Mr Shetty.",1,-1,-1

Can't say it's brainless comedy because there is no comedy. It's not a comedy it's a tragedy.

What we have here is a ponderous, character-driven Cold War style espionage film that takes it time telling its intriguing story and has a satisfying payoff.

I was happy that some of the twists have much more depth than at initial glance and feel more natural than a lot of shock value storytelling. Pine and Newton do most of the heavy lifting and fit their roles well. Pine gives off some serious elder Brosnan vibes here and I'm here for it. The story ends up being quite heartfelt and bypasses most of the cliches that plague the genre.

It's a very slow burn, and I can see how many would become impatient. I'm also not a fan of timeline back and forths, and this has many, and more than just two timelines. However, although not perfect, the timelines are what kept me intrigued to continue to watch, as they revealed small pieces of the puzzle throughout. The reward at the end is worth it imo, I just wish the felt-longer 101 min runtime with slow pacing had been shorter and faster. Huge credit goes to Pine and Newton for their exceptional performances, and another reason why I didn't throw in the towel mid-way, plus adding Fishburne and Pryce into the mix was a bonus. So if you don't go into this expecting a James Bond action spy thriller, and have the patience, you may enjoy it once it reaches the end.

The story itself unfolds layer by layer, and the economic run time is refreshing. There are just enough hints to the truth to make you think you know what's going on, but not enough to spoil the final act revelations. It's deftly played, emotionally truthful and gripping right to the end, with Newton especially impressive with her layered performance.",8,1,1
429,429,All the Old Knives,6.1,Mystery Thriller,12-Apr-22,Don't expect James Bond. This one is a lot deeper.,"Bottom line is that All the Old Knives is a really fine and absorbing movie. I recommend it, no hesitation. The rest of what I have to say about it just fills in details.

Spy thrillers on the screen seem to fall into two categories. The first and by far the most numerous is the James Bond path: fill the screen with action and when in doubt, add in more car chases, hand-to-hand fights, and explosions. These efforts can be extremely well done and give you a great thrill ride and if that's what you want, there's no lack of choices out there. But the generic problem with those was nicely nailed by that very wise writer Ursula Le Guin: if the only thing going on is unceasing physical action, that's a sure sign no story is being told. (Or words to that effect -- I had trouble finding the exact quote.)

So then we have the second category: the John LeCarre camp. Much rarer and ultimately more interesting. Sylistically the daddy of all of these is The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965, starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom). All the Old Knives is spookily close to a modern version of that. Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton play now-retired intelligence officers tasked with getting to the bottom of an 8-year-old unsolved mystery: what went wrong with the way their agency dealt with the infamous Flight 127 in Vienna, taken over and destroyed by terrorists? Was there a mole among them, and who? The story gets laid out for us in flashbacks and replays of their memories (and sometimes flashbacks within the flashbacks), bit by bit.

Here's a spoiler for free: there's not a SINGLE car chase, fight, or explosion. Not one. (There is one gunshot.) This is grittier, realer, and tenser. If you think this is boring -- here, have a lollipop. Go away and let the grownups watch it.

The two stars Pine and Newton virtually carry the whole movie, with a bit of help from veterans Laurence Fishburne and Jonathan Pryce in supporting roles. But they are all excellent and the dialog is impressively realistic, constantly engaging. Following the twists and turns is not meant to be easy, I think, but the scenes connect seamlessly and flow beautifully. Is there a message underneath it all? It's never said out loud, but I think it is just that in this spy business, everybody taking part -- sooner or later, right side or wrong side -- loses. Be prepared to have a mix of feelings by the end.",8,1,1

Its got pieces and bits of material from 70 and 80's classics, like ''sting'' and ''the mole'', and the story is pretty tense to follow.

A bit slow on plot speed, and some lack on prescicionediting, its overflowed with decent filmatographic and dramaturgic cleverness, and the surprises never seems to end.

434,434,All the Old Knives,6.1,Mystery Thriller,11-Apr-22,Don't waste your time on this spy unthriller dud,"As ""All The Old Knives"" (2022 release from the UK; 101 min.) opens, a plane has been hijacked and is sitting on a runway in Vienna, and it doesn't look good. We then go to ""8 Years later"", as the head of the CIA station informed agent Henry Pelham that ""headquarters"" is reopening the file on Flight 127 on suspicion that the hijackers were helped from inside the CIA station... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from Danish director Janus Metz (""Borg/McEnroe""). Here he attempts to bring us a good ol' fashioned spy thriller. The CIA! In Vienna! Plane hijacked! There might be a mole! On paper it sounds great but alas, the execution of it is woeful, and I'm being mild. There is no tension whatsoever, the endless going back-and-forth between the now (2020) and then (2012) doesn't help matters either. And then there are just absurd details like this one: the CIA station in Vienna is in the midst of the hijacking drama, with literally lives at stake. Then, out of nowhere one of the main characters simply gets up and leaves as she has another commitment. What?!?!? In the middle of the most important meeting of her career, she has something better to do?!? Insane. I quickly lost interest in the movie after that. Chris Pine (as CIA agent Henry) seeks (and fails) to become a Pierce Brosnan-like ""international man of mystery"". Laurence Fishburne (as head of the CIA station in Vienna) looks utterly lost, or bored, more likely both. Tandiwe Newton (as 2012 CIA agent Celia) is sleepwalking much of the time.

""All the Old Knives"" opened this past weekend in a few theaters, while also streaming on Amazon Prime (where I saw it). I love me a good ol' fashioned spy thriller (where are you, ""The Third Man""?). ""All the Old Knives"" is anything but a thriller. Call it an unthriller dud. Of course, don't take my word for it, so go ahead and check it out, and draw your own conclusion.",4,-1,-1
435,435,All the Old Knives,6.1,Mystery Thriller,10-Apr-22,How can a movie so short feel so long?,"When you see the Amazon Original logo on a movie, it usually serves a warning. You're going to get a slow moving film with lots of slow panning camera shots, cinematography ridden with lens flares, mist filter lighting and lots of closeups of the actor's faces with the rest of the scene blurred out in the background.

For once though, at least the color grading was nice.

The movie starts off somewhat intriguing, mostly due to Chris Pine, who seems to have prematurely entered the Neeson / Travolta Geezer teaser phase of his career after a few high profile misfires. But the plot quickly unravels as the narrative loses focus and becomes bogged down in cell phone records and endless flashbacks to the two main character's relationship. This is the core of the story, and it's supposed to lay the groundwork for the big reveal at the end, but the two leads have little to no chemistry, the love scenes and romance has no spark, and therefore the entire emotional core of the story falls apart.

As the plot meanders on from flashback to flashback, it becomes more and more ludicrous. Never mind that the CIA would never allow lovers working in the field like this, no one except Laurence Fishbourne feels like a CIA agent. The side characters are just window dressing with the exception of Johnathan Pryce, who get show off his acting chops in one scene.

The response to the hijackers is ludicrous, as is the entire story about how the Germans or Austrians don't want to release 5 prisoners. Ridiculous. Neither of these countries would risk a plane full of people being killed on the internet over 5 prisoners they could easily track after release. Never mind that they don't actually hold high profile terrorists in those countries.

Even more ridiculous is the plot about the Informant in Russia, naturally an entirely innocent man.

This is where the obligatory amazon wokeness comes in. Aside from one, the white characters are all either corrupt or killers. The non-white characters are predictably flawless and blameless. And of course the Russians are portrayed as pure evil again.

Even more ridiculous is a line about a character dying in Iran because they don't have medicine there due to western sanctions. Who writes this garbage? Iran has better medical care than most middle eastern nations and a life expectancy of 77 which is higher than most East European nations and only 2 years lower than the US. Sanction against Iran don't even include medical products.

As mentioned the portrayal of the CIA is ludicrous as well, presenting them like some incompetent squad of hobbyist hitmen who sell out innocent informants at a whim and kill their own agents in elaborate theatrical setups over a phone call instead of bringing them in for questioning.

What good is there to say about the film? Some of the acting is good. The color grading is nice to look at for once. And it's not 2 hours, though the slow pace makes it feel longer.",2,0,-1

Now a big fuss is being made on a kidnapping by terrorists. But that is really something that makes sense - considering what they demand and how it is being handled. It seems that there is more to it ... and we are about to discover what happened by the people who were involved in a negotiation/rescue mission talk and reminisce about it.

There is some nudity in this, something I did not expect to be honest. Just putting it out there (no pun intended), for those who care one way or the other.

The story might have been fine in capable hands, but this cheapie with poor acting sort of plods along and you can tell by how long there is to go whether there is something else evolving to not care about.

I saw one review complaining about Chris Pine's face - you should not be allowed to post reviews here, let me tell you that.

So here goes, this is not a groundbreaking thriller, but if you've liked Ghostwriter from Ewan Mcgregor, you'll love this. Strong performances by both the main actors and the supporting cast also did their job nicely. This story is not new, but how original can an espionage thriller get? The twist at the end I kind of saw coming but it was surprising the way it went down nonetheless. Soundtrack is nice, visuals you see are nice too, gives you the feels of an old fashion thriller. The chemistry between the main characters is excellent too, keeps the story intact. Movie is not long or too short but perfect, doesn't add unnecessary scenes nor rush through scenes. Amozon released two good movies at the same time, watch this one definitely if you like thrillers, watch The Outfit too, that one is also a good movie.

I deem it ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy lite.""

At its one-hour forty-minute runtime, Janus Metz directs efficiently, crisscrossing between multiple timelines at ease with no confusion. Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton both deliver solid performances, playing up the ambiguity and maintaining a palpable tension in long dialogue-driven setpieces.

Knives is a heavily dialogue-driven film that requires the audience's full active attention. There are many ""Is he/she lying?"" and ""What did he/she mean by that?"" moments for the audience to interpret. It is fun in the same vein as a detective mystery board game.

I love this type of spy film as it reflects what real spy work would be like; a ton of interviewing people and fact-checking. For those looking for this type of spy film, I recommend Tomas Alfredson's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It takes an arthouse approach but also makes it about something beyond its spy plot.

What makes it even better is that it's a great film that's impressively paced, funny and pretty heartwarming. A love letter to animation by including as many different forms of it as possible, including the more disturbing ones.

John Mulaney cleverly chooses to play it almost completely straight which really helps him bounce off Andy Samberg's energy and adorable naivety. Rounding out the main three is Kiki Layne, who is just as likeable and energetic.

I have to come clean first, as I have never actually watched the original Rescue Rangers tv show, although I have always had a firm desire to do so at some point. Knowing little to nothing about the characters at hand besides there small presence in some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons- I still found myself to deeply enjoy this film for what it was, and loved its new take and incredible satire on the animation industry. First off, the cast is just amazing; John Mulaney, Andy Samberg, Seth Rogen, Will Arnett, J. K. Simmons, Keegan Michael KEy, Eric Bana, Tim Robinson, and so many more- not to mention its written and directed by Akiva Schaffer of The Lonely Island- there is just so much to geek out about here. The script can go through some familiar elements at times, and it definitely is inspired by the likes of films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but definitely better than other films with that same copycat idea like Cool World or Monkeybone. Besides some basic bland formula structure, I enjoyed the humor of this film deeply- and loved the way they handled the references throughout- especially with Ugly Sonic and the numerous Seth Rogen characters which had me dying every time they were on screen. It also had a surprising amount of heart to it as well, and even made me tear up towards the end there, which I have to say I was not expecting from a film about two talking chipmunks. In the end, Chip 'n Dale may not be as perfect as Roger Rabbit but it's a wonderful and hilarious spiritual successor that I certainly wouldn't mind watching again and am disappointed to see go straight to streaming.

It's a satire on the whole animation business. Lucky for Disney, they have a large roster of animation to choose from.

They left no stone unturned about what Geekdom is like today and every stone turned made me laugh out loud

I'm going to keep this review short. It's a very mediocre plot that we've seen done hundreds of times. The fact it was produced by Disney meant we got our nostalgic filled references to countless properties but that's just not enough... it DOES make fun of itself which is good and some of the issues that Hollywood is facing but I'm sure this is going to fly over many of the viewers heads and date itself fast.

I watched it a few times, by myself and with others - the humor is very dry and meta. It's a movie that tries to make fun of all of these troupes, which it succeeds well in for those who get it but that's about it...

Pretty much the only thing this movie has going for it is that it somehow manages to use every animated cameo these screenwriters could think of, including Mantis from Kung Fu Panda, aka the worst character in that movie, and Ugly Sonic, one of the biggest internet phenomenons of the 2020's so far, this film had one job, be funny, and it couldn't even do that, I don't think I laughed once in this entire movie.

There's barely any jokes, funny scenes or funny characters and the existing ""jokes"" was very lame and tame.

I constantly question comedy nowadays. When people are working with the things they love and get the opportunity to do a movie, which only happens to relatively few, there should be TONS of funny jokes, wacky characters and funny scenes to chose from. Yet it feel like most comedies, like this one, is just a soulless chore for movie makers, that they're happy to just complete. Who OKs scripts like this? Nobody gave any input on the lack of comedy?

464,464,Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers,7.0,Animation Action Adventure,07-Oct-22,terrible voice casting & performances kept pulling me out of the movie,"Strange that this movie exists as it'll mainly gain the attention of 40-somethings such as myself who used to turn on the classic show right after getting home from school every afternoon back in the early 1990's. However, if you're going to make a throwback to a beloved childhood classic, why base it around a story that completely disrespects the source material? Oh, all those adventures the rescue rangers went on; turns out that even in-universe, it was all fake. It was all a TV show. Then they combine ""live action"" 3D characters with more traditionally 2D animated ones, but the 3D characters still don't look realistic in the least bit, residing uncomfortably in the uncanny valley. I couldn't help but wonder ""what's the point"" if they're going to both play it so safe ro make characters cute for the kids, but at the same time warp and confuse the existing Disney cartoon universe in a way akin to the more recent episodes of ""Doctor Who"". It narrows the appeal demographic to 6-28 (kids and adults too young to have cared about the property in the first place).

Worst of all, the voice casting for Chip and Dale sounds nothing like their characterizations on the TV show, much less the original Disney shorts from the 1940's and 50's. It's almost as though the filmmakers went out of their way just to distract from the narrative or to show that, ""you, the fans of the original property, don't really count. Do you have a problem with how we've modernized everything about your beloved childhood characters? Well, just deal with it"". I did. I turned this abomination off after about 20 minutes. Maybe things pick up toward the end? Is it really worth getting tortured for that long?",3,-1,-1
465,465,Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers,7.0,Animation Action Adventure,21-May-22,"With a solid cast, strong visuals, and a creative adventure, the movie delivers on all fronts.","Having become best friends since elementary school rambunctious goofball Dale (Andy Samberg) and mature down to earth Chip (John Mulaney) hone their talents and go to Hollywood where they eventually land their own hit TV show with Chip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangers in the late 80s. After season three where Dale bailed on the show to pursue his own pet project Double-0-Dale, the show was cancelled leading to a falling out between Chip and Dale. Now present day Dale banks off the nostalgia of fans through social media and fan conventions while Chip works as an insurance salesman. When former cast member Monterrey Jack (Eric Bana) is kidnapped Chip and Dale decide to reunite to help look for him with the help of LAPD ally Det. Ellie Steckler (KiKi Layne). They soon find out that Peter ""Sweet Pete"" Pan (Will Arnett) is behind not only Monterey's disappearance, but the disappearance of several other toons where they're being ""bootlegged"" by being kidnapped and forced to star in cheap foreign knock-offs.

Running from 1989 through 1990, Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers was one of a number of iconic Disney produced TV series that made up the programming block The Disney Afternoon and became a mainstay of children's TV both in first run syndication as well as subsequent re-airings on Disney Channel and Disney XD (Fka Toon Disney). Development began on an adaptation of the series in 2014 with Robert Rugan slated to write and direct the film as an origin story for the Rescue Rangers done in the style of the 2007 Alvin and the Chipmunks film with fully CGI rendered models, this version got stuck in development limbo and was scrapped with project successor Akiva Schafer replacing Rugan, and writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand where the film would be a more self-referential and ""meta"" take on thye property similar to Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Looney Tunes: Back in Action wherein the film creates a world where cartoons are treated like ""real"" people. Andy Sandburg, who had worked with Schafer on films such as Hot Rod and Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, was cast as Dale while John Mulaney was cast as Chip. Now arriving on Disney+, Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers delivers in the best possible way.

The movie is really solid, despite being marketed as a commentary on reboots the movie doesn't build itself upon references alone and remembers to build characters and a story around its references. Both John Mulaney and Andy Samberg have great chemistry as Chip and Dale respectively with Mulaney's more sardonic style well suited to Chip's grounded and serious nature while Samberg fits Dale's laid back and care free personality excellently. You really buy the two of them as former friends who've had a falling out and they make for an engaging duo making good jokes even better and bad jokes tolerable (though there aren't too many of those). The movie keeps itself to a lean 90 minutes and avoids many of the ramble and awkward pause type jokes you see in a lot of comedies of this type which is a major plus in its favor. The mixture of animation styles on display be it Dale's CGI model or Chip's traditionally animated model work great in the context of the world created with lots of fun references in both the foreground and background that I'm sure will lend themselves well to repeated viewings. The supporting cast are well utilized with the likes of J. K. Simmons, Keegan-Michael Key, Eric Bana, and Dennis Haysbert put to excellent use (so nice to see J. K. Simmons in a good movie after the awful Marmaduke), but stealing every scene he's in is undeniably Will Arnett as a villainous older pot bellied version of Peter Pan named ""Sweet Pete"" who's plan is basically kidnapping and mutilating cartoon characters and forcing them to star in Video Brinquedo or Dingo Pictures level schlocky rip-off animated films being a delightfully silly but slightly macabre plan that lends itself to solid humor. In many ways Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers feels like the movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action clearly wanted to be but wasn't.

Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers is a lot of fun. From its solid cast, rapid fire pace, creatively realized world filled with background and foreground details, and solid humor, the movie gives you not only the best version of this take you didn't know you wanted.

I thought it would be similar to the recent DuckTales reboot which I truly loved, although I was skeptic at first. Growing up with the old-school Disney animation, I'm always a little hesitant whenever a reboot gets made in modern animation style. But such is life. However, when I first saw the trailer for this movie (that I thought was gonna be a show) and that it would be nothing like the original whatsoever, my hopes were shattered and rightly so. I mean, I actually cringed at the sight of different animation styles in the same movie (never liked those type of movies) and the storyline was just so terribly boring. This movie could've been way better with a different approach to the storyline and they should've stuck to one type of animation. I decided to watch against my better judgement and that's on me. God, I hope RR will eventually get a series reboot to make us forget this travesty...",4,-1,-1
469,469,Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers,7.0,Animation Action Adventure,20-May-22,What an absolutely bizarre age of movies this is,"Okay, look. I know I say this about almost everything that ever gets made at this point, but when I saw the trailer for Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, I truly, deeply believed that I was watching a parody. This isn't just a quip for the review, like when I jokingly wrote that I was convinced Detective Pikachu was really a College Humor spoof or something.

Here, it genuinely took me a second to realize that the trailer was posted on the official Disney Studios channel on YouTube; that the teaser for a CG'd reboot of Rescue Rangers -- with music by Doja Cat and ""starring the Lonely Island"" -- WASN'T a sketch by Screen Junkies. But hey, the one where Deadpool plays Pikachu turned out to be a real movie. I really should've guessed.

Now, obviously, this isn't to say that the movie is necessarily terrible. It clearly isn't taking itself that seriously and so there is no use to complain too much. But why is THIS the premise of a revamp of The Rescue Rangers?

More precisely, it follows in the footsteps of films like Looney Tunes Back in Action (2003), showing these beloved animal characters resurface as washed-up has-beens, some of whom have undergone cosmetic changes (e.g. Dale's upgrade to 3D animation) to stay hot and relevant. Alas, it also takes some cues from Space Jam 2 and the utterly loathsome Tom and Jerry, being a cartoon-live-action hybrid full of references to famous IPs that you're meant to laugh and clap at. We see Roger Rabbit and MC Skat Kat for a little bit, but Disney isn't fooling anyone; there is no legible justification to put Chip and Dale -- or at least the 1990s RR versions -- in this kind of setting.

Of course it's not impossible to revamp the old Disney Afternoon shows in a way that also calls back to the days of yore. Just look at how well 2017's Ducktales did. But that one didn't randomly act as if Scrooge McDuck was an actor this whole time and that his escapades were filmed on the same soundstage where Roger Rabbit shoots his shorts.

That's not just an analogy, by the way. We do see Scrooge in the movie, along with many other animated ""actors"", not just limited to those found in 2D Disney classics. (There's no Aki Ross, but a boy can dream.) As another critic noted, this is a deeply weird film before we even get to the castration jokes (the PAW Patrol crew are implied to have done something truly horrid to a police officer's manhood), the loathly revelation of Gadget and Zipper's plentiful half-fly, half-mouse offspring, and the realization of the sheer amount of animated media being referenced here -- this Disney movie calls back to the Zemeckisverse, Gumby, anime, Rick and Morty, South Park, and, inadvertently, Bojack Horseman (the film all but ""typecasts"" Will Arnett as a bloated, washed-up actor in a world of both humans and man-beasts).

There are several fun gags based around all these different animation styles (Hell, I dare say this romp is more varied and interesting to watch than Ralph Breaks the Internet, another flick that likely paved the way for this one) and there are jokes at the expense of 2019's Cats, the nightmarish original design of Sonic for 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog, and even Disney's own Lion King remake that I especially appreciate. It's rich coming from the same people who just sucked all life and energy out of Monterey Jack and Gadget (all the bona fide 2D animation seems reserved for throwaway cameos), but still.

While I occasionally enjoyed the meta-humor and irony, I didn't properly ""register"" them at first. After Free Guy and The Matrix: Resurrection (on top of all the other similar films I've named thus far), you can't really hide your creative bankruptcy and nostalgia-baiting behind the veneer of irony. On the contrary, I've actually come to EXPECT movies like this to make fun of corporate greed while exemplifying that very greed. I'd be shocked if there WEREN'T jokes about reboots and ""Hollywood nonsense"" in this.

The main takeaway for me is the following fact: the kiddie film category isn't just for kiddies anymore. Yes, this is a cutesy Disney movie that doesn't have any swears and nudity but let's be honest, small children aren't going to comprehend half of what is happening in this. It's not like Spider-Man: No Way Home, where there's something for everyone but perhaps mostly for the veteran fans. With this movie, it's official; we are now making ""children's films"" that are wholly and exclusively for manchildren.

In any case, I guess I'm not too offended. I've found Chip and Dale to be total dicks in almost every canonical appearance I've seen from them -- even when they appeared with no names in 1943's Private Pluto. If Disney wants to ""ruin"" them, I won't lose any sleep.",5,-1,0

The number of recent Hollywood blockbusters based on decades old characters - Sonic and Space Jam stick out - made the trailer for this film look like just another cash grab. Rather than taking the original Rescue Rangers and making a cinematic feature version, they've turned them into actors, and made it more akin to Who Framed Roger Rabbit (which is a recommendation when you watch it on Disney+). Replacing Tress MacNeille as Chip, and Zipper with Dennis Haysbert seems a step too far.

Here though, Disney look to have steered into the skid. On top of casting Tim Robinson as Ugly Sonic and a CGI aged (given we all know he doesn't age) Paul Rudd, they've enlisted Disney legend Jim Cummings voicing six characters, He-Man stalwart Alan Oppenheimer to do a couple, and then there's Seth Rogen talking to himself. The depth of the intellectual property the film makers have played with is impressive. Who ever at WB let Disney use Ben Affleck's Batman, thank you.

The best big issue is the music, whether it's the bad pop music or the rap music that seems to be put in all of these cartoons lately, it's all out of phase with the content.

The only good thing about the film is the original series got a bluray release. The new sonic films at least try to do things well and stay true to the source. If you love the old show, any of the classic Chip and Dale shorts, or good films this is an easy pass, don't waste your time.",1,-1,-1

This film did something that I haven't come across before. Towards the end of the movie, it'll leave you feeling like you are and will continue to be a part of the movie. Get it? I was like ""That was a good movie, I'm glad I watched it, but WHY did I watch it?"" It's tough to explain this feeling without spoiling it so I'll leave it there.

Incantation is a story about a mother's drive to protect her daughter from a curse, no matter what/who comes in her way.

The movie is shot in found-footage (FF, cinematic technique in which all or a substantial part of the work is presented as if it were discovered film or video recordings); showing a movie in the form of a recording is fine, but the purpose of the recording and the audience's involvement with the recording is what IMO makes or breaks the FF sub-genre and I have to say, they've made really GOOD use of this technique, just by better writing. I so wish I could tell more.

Horror movies that make you feel uneasy/creeped out are so much better than the ones that heavily rely on cheap jump scares. I counted a grand total of ONE jump scare in this movie, so that is a major plus in my books. There's this continued sense of eeriness and the creeps (goosebumps galore) throughout the movie, all well conveyed by the audio-visuals and just plain silence. The acting by everybody involved was good, including the kid.

The movie does have flaws IMO, a couple dumb moments here and there, but you can't expect to make everyone happy as a moviemaker. If I look past that, it's a regular horror movie with a certain twist that makes it a GOOD horror movie, the best of the year so far...?

It's essentially a found-footage film but the lead characters frequently travel through claustrophobic spaces on their own, making it nearly impossible for the makers to retain this aspect all through. As a result, you'll randomly see some third-person shots in between all the shaky cam, clashing with the film's overall visual structure.

All said and done, it's a pretty decent effort that delivers on the atmosphere but struggles to connect past and present events within the plot.",5,0,0
486,486,Incantation,6.2,Horror Mystery,30-Jul-22,Novel Taiwanese horror,"INCANTATION (2022) is a new Taiwanese horror film currently showing on Netflix and I found it a really good movie. It's a multi-layered story told via the 'found footage' format with a single mother raising a young girl who she comes to believe is suffering from a malevolent curse. It transpires that current events are linked to something that happened six years previously, when a team of ""ghost busters"" visited a shrine at a religious cult worshipping an entity called the Buddha-Mother and entered a forbidden tunnel.

This is a deeply involved little film with plenty of themes, so although it's slow-moving in places it always holds the attention. It's well-acted throughout and it goes for realism which makes it harrowing. The scenes in the tunnel are very scary indeed which makes this one of the most chilling modern horrors I've seen in a while, and they also pull off a visual trick on the audience that make the eyes play up; I've never seen this done in another film. I'd normally consider it a gimmick elsewhere but it works well here.",8,1,1

Give it a try. Well worth your time.

I watched it at night alone in my room to really feel what the movie wants me to feel. I liked its interactive nature but it was painfully boring to watch. It was too long that I just forced myself to finish the movie. I liked its ending because it makes you wonder if all that she's saying also applies in the real world which makes the viewers hesitate to chant.

489,489,Incantation,6.2,Horror Mystery,09-Jul-22,One of the scariest films of 2022.,"'Incantation' is Asian horror at the pinnacle of its creepiness. I personally am a fan of Asian horror films, having seen classics like Onibaba and Kuroneko, and more current ones like The Medium and The Sadness. As a horror fan, these types of films hit different for me primarily because they rely on storytelling, atmosphere and cultural elements as opposed to unnecessary gore or jump scares.

Without giving away spoilers, to provide a brief synopsis of 'Incantation' I'll say it revolves around a woman who has recently gone through a supernatural experience six years prior and could not care for her young daughter because of the trauma. Now regaining custody rights, her daughter goes home from a foster home to live with her mom and it doesn't take long for creepy things to start happening. We learn the supernatural elements deal with a tunnel and a curse.... That's all I'm gonna say. The film is presented as found footage and the narrative shifts between the events six years prior and the present day.

Again, this movie is very eerie, it's not your standard haunted house flick, and it will stay with you, for sure. If you're into Taiwanese cinema and are a horror fan I can't recommend it highly enough; I was impressed with the practical effects, the performances and how the tension built throughout the film. It's on Netflix now so definitely watch it.",9,1,1
490,490,Incantation,6.2,Horror Mystery,02-Aug-22,A Taiwanese found-footage feature with a lot to like,"Deciding to upload a new video, a blogger recounts how her daughter fell victim to a terrible curse after she and her friends visited a sacred ceremony in a remote village and upset the deity at the center of the ritual, forcing her to extreme measures to stop the curse from affecting her.

This one manages to have a lot to really like about it. One of the more enjoyable aspects here comes from the intriguing and entertaining setup that seeks to utilize a slightly obscure series of intentions to generate its scares. While operating within clearly-defined fields here with the traditional series of scares and hauntings that it's building off of, the central crux of the storyline here being presented through the implementation of a curse carries some weight here. That there's a healthy backstory in place for the occult practices in place here, ranging from the elaborate altar area and strict adherence to customs while in the village provides a fine grounding for the spiritual beliefs in place. Knowing full well that the locals forbid them from performing certain actions yet doing so anyway allows for a more reasonable backdrop as to why it gets unleashed and follows them around which definitely adds a darker dimension to the second half as the curse takes hold and the frantic nature of the villagers' actions towards her and the group becomes increasingly more chilling. It's all generally enjoyable enough to keep the film engaging for a fun time alongside its running time. That serves well here in getting to the film's best feature in the numerous supernatural antics featured here. While some of the tricks and gags on display are nothing new, including voices crying out in the distance, an unresponsive attitude from the daughter who contorts her body unnaturally, her insistence on a playmate no one else can see, and even doors slamming shut in front of witnesses, others are quite fun. The scenes involving the serious illness and strange body marks that start appearing on the daughter's classmates start hinting that something creepy is happening to those around her. Footage of demonic activity occurring in the house or candid sequences of the public engaging in destructive acts of suicide around others showcase the strength and power exhibited here and offer up some impressive visuals along the way which increases the brutality of the curse in fine form. That all provides the grounding for the frantic and frenzied finale that manages to tie together both of these aspects, with the sequences in the village showing the group encountering the truth behind the curse bringing the religious aspects together with some fine moments of brutality. That this is all in service of a spectacular twist that comes off incredibly well gives everything a much darker bent and has quite a lot to enjoy here. There isn't much wrong here but there are some slight factors. The biggest factor here stems from the aforementioned usage of cliched motifs and ideas that are overutilized in most other genre fare in this style. The use of numerous repeated tactics that range from the sudden shock-jumps of something appearing behind someone or a loud crashing bang accompanying an object acting unnaturally without warning carries through quite a lot of the first half. Even the theme and central topic here of the curse originating through the recklessness she and her crew display while investigating the ceremonial ritual is all highly uninspired and doesn't do much to separate itself from a slew of similar films. Another factor with this one is the obviously unnecessary found-footage format presented here, offering very little in terms of obvious need as for why it was utilized. On top of that, there are so many of the usual debilitating factors that come about from featuring the format such as headache-inducing shaking camera movements, obscured vision by ducking behind objects at the wrong moment, or being carried along at moments that should hinder a person's natural ability to preserve their life. So much of the final half here really should not be filmed with their lives in that much danger yet the constant need to retreat back to grab the camera comes with the territory. These factors all manage to highlight the drawbacks featured here.

491,491,Incantation,6.2,Horror Mystery,15-Jul-22,Hits you on a personal level,"It was only a couple of months ago, when I accidentally stumbled upon this movie called 'The Medium'! It was also a found footage/mockumentary-styled horror feature with comparable notions which were also about forbidden deities, ancient rituals, and unendurable curses! For your information, I loved it for not only its competent presentation but also for the countless frights it successfully produced!

Now coming back to this movie, 'Incantation'; While it does have uncanny resemblances, but I must confess that the core approach has been vastly different in here. The execution, for the most part, inherently prioritizes the emotional susceptibilities of the characters over the more prevailing and traditional characteristics of the Horror aspects.

Although I'm in no way implying that it wasn't scary, trust me, it was! But the emphasis here has mostly been on this Mother-Daughter duo and the profound bond they shared. And to tell you the truth, that's exactly what made this all the more special. Despite the inconsistencies and some minor flaws, I was able to empathize with the characters as I had gradually become an active part in both their lives as well as in their quest to find serenity and redemption!",8,1,1

493,493,Incantation,6.2,Horror Mystery,30-Aug-22,A very mixed experience.,"A movie that wanted all the credibility of found footage but didn't want to really put in the work. I know that found footage means you can sort of just wing it with the camera work and not really bother with the music but this would have worked better in a normal format.

It feels very deliberate how EVERYTHING gets filmed and the documentary approach (interviews with characters) doesn't help anything, the #horror scenes are cheesy and unfortunately they do include non-diegetic music.

There are positives though: although not a great example of horror that sears off the screen, there's a more than adequate story of a person trying to rebuilt their life under the ugly, watchful eye of those who would take someone's child away against the latter's will. They play it for a lot of pathos and go quite too for with it to be frank. It's not that I don't feel for these characters and their plight. It's that the whole thing feels like the author is exploiting their misery in lieu of better horroring.

The flashback element, where they are staying with that traditional family...I think maybe that should have been the whole movie. It creeped me out big time to see them painting that poor little girl.

There are other memorable moments that occur as the thing goes on and which I won't spoil. They admirably use a quite feather touch approach as we the audience just helplessly watch something that just might end up bad.

The final act carries a special sense of dread as we hang in the balance and it's fairly effective.

So I took his word and opted to sit down and watch what writer J. P. Davis and director Tarik Saleh had to offer with ""The Contractor"".

And I will say that ""The Contractor"" was definitely watchable, but it wasn't an outstanding action thriller. Whereas it certainly was entertaining, I just found the storyline to be somewhat bland and generic. And writer J. P. Davis just didn't bring much of anything new to the genre. A shame really, because there certainly was pontential for a lot more here.

The storyline, while somewhat generic, was interesting enough and made for good entertainment. So yeah, I will say that ""The Contractor"" is worth taking the time to sit down and watch. Just keep in mind that you are not in for a revolutionary action thriller here. The pacing of the storyline was good, and there was a good combination of character development and action throughout the course of the movie.

Was ""The Contractor"" predictable? You betcha. But it was not really a hindrance for the plot, because the movie ended up being rather enjoyable nonetheless.

The movie had a good cast ensemble, and it was nice to see Chris Pine in a movie such as this one. Ben Foster was also rather nicely cast for the movie, and it was definitely a treat to see Keifer Sutherland in the movie, and he had a rather good role in ""The Contractor"".

All in all, then ""The Contractor"" makes good entertainment for a single viewing. And I do say single viewing, because there simply wasn't enough contents to the storyline to support more than a single viewing here. So yeah, I am not going to be returning to watch ""The Contractor"" a second time.

501,501,The Contractor,5.8,Action Drama Thriller,15-Apr-22,"Slowburning Jason Bourne Clone. The action starts at about 35 minutes after a slowburning introduction, so give it some time...","Obviously a Jason Bourne copycat, but that doesnt mean it is a terrible movie.

The good: I kinda appreciated the slow start, by which I got to know the CHARACTERS. At the start this movie is basically a character drama. But only after 35 minutes or so, the full blown action is unleashed. So give it some time, you'll be rewarded for your patience, OR simply skip the first 35 minutes.

The bad: many will get bored by the slowburning start, but give this story some time to start up.

More bad: there are some credibility issues with the story. For example they raid a laboratory and within minutes the German police is present with full gear. NOT likely to happen for real. But perhaps I am nitpicking...

To conclude, this is NOT as good as any of the Jason Bourne movies, but in lack of any new Jason Bourne movies this will (barely) do,

Robert Redford may be too much, but with age, I think he may be heading towards the start of his real career.

Unfortunately, just having him hog almost the entire screen time doesn't save this formulaic film from being completely average.

506,506,The Contractor,5.8,Action Drama Thriller,12-May-22,"Generic, dull action thriller","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful

Special Forces sergeant James Harper (Chris Pine ) is involuntarily discharged from the military, suddenly ineligible for the benefits he thought he'd get. With a wife and son to support, and desperate for work, he turns to his friend, Mike (Ben Foster) who recommends some private contractor work for Rusty (Kiefer Sutherland), another disgruntled former soldier who believes the service owes him. On a routine assignment in Berlin, Harper discovers all is not as it seems, and must race against time to get to the bottom of it.

While in pre production, The Contractor was going under the working title of Violence of Action, before a last minute script rewrite was applied. So it's an interesting tidbit that it went from copying the title of a straight to DVD Steven Seagal film, to a straight to DVD Wesley Snipes one. And the end result is ultimately one as formulaic and unremarkable as one of the best from those two auteurs of the action genre, just a little glossier and finely tuned, but no less than the sum of its parts.

In spite of the banality of the story, it still seems to be aiming to be something higher, with frequent flashbacks of Harper's father when he was a kid, conditioning him to think and act like a soldier, as well as the general theme of soldiers struggling to adjust to civilian life. It's all pretty flat and humourless, shot in the dull, grey lighting that is typical of many modern films. Performances wise, Pine has a reliable presence in a tough guy role, while Sutherland applies a raging Jack Bauer like intensity as the guy in charge, but neither can lift the dull material any higher than it is.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya ... been there, worked there, as well for private firms as for NGOs and also some GOs.

Now to this film: It's a good flick, yet overly dramatized and in a certain way quite inaccurate. It's a caricatural portrayal - and I didn't expect anything else coming from Hollywood - of the private security and military industry as some ""shady, dubious, greedy and highly illegal"" entity that collaborates with The Government and does stuff they can't officially do. Yes, stuff like that does unfortunately exist, but this doesn't even scratch the 0,1% mark of all the work internationally and if Mark Zuckerberg's social network would fact-check this it would not even get a ""mostly false"", but proper ""fake news"" stamp. You can't depict a complete industry by single incidents.

But hey, it's Hollywood, it's what they like to pass as a message, because looking at the direction they have taken over the last twenty years, it has become clear they don't seem to be any more interested in producing entertainment and making profit, but rather to function as political and (pseudo)-moral activists no matter the cost. Hence also the obligatory inclusion of the word ""mercenary"", because THAT'S what it comes all down to for Hollywood .... and they couldn't be any more wrong than that.

Chris Pine does a solid performance and the chemistry with Ben Foster is clearly there. The plot is over simplified by people not familiar with the industry and who must have written their story based on hearsay, NYT articles and a good portion of (bad) imagination. The movie doesn't know exactly what it wants to be: An action flick? Well, not quite, with too much drama and talking. A drama? Well, not quite either, with too much action. So it sits somewhere in between and is neither a pleaser for fans of one or the other. Still, the production value is there, the cast is there ... unfortunately the film isn't quite. It's absolutely fine for a one-time watch, just don't believe every lie they try to sell as The Truth. But coming from a biased director, who had done in the past a biased documentary about Guantanamo Bay called ""Gitmo"", the result was unsurprising.",5,-1,0
520,520,The Contractor,5.8,Action Drama Thriller,01-Apr-22,Well-made action film.,"The Contractor starring Chris Pine is a well-made actioner with an easy-to-follow plot, terrific performances and intense action sequences. It might not be the most original or unique film in terms of plot, but it is an engaging watch with plenty of excitement and intrigue. Chris Pine shines in his performance as the protagonist, while other actors such as Ben Foster, Kiefer Sutherland and Gillian Jacobs are also impressive. The action sequences are quite grounded and realistically done, with several moments bound to catch you off-guard. The background music beautifully gels with the proceedings, and the editing is sharp enough to keep the storytelling focused. While not being totally unpredictable, The Contractor serves you with raw action and tension worthy of your time and money, especially if you like action films. Give it a watch!",10,1,1

The viewer is glued to his seat as he watches how James extricates himself from a life-threatening situation.

While the focus is on the action, the film doesn't ignore human interest. The drama is heartfelt like the scene with James and the scientist in his lab. Or how Mike dotes on his crippled son. Or the all-too-brief scene with James and Virgil at the safehouse. Or the encounter between James and Mike in the parking lot.

The movie also shines a soft light on the situation of ex-military men when they are discharged from the service.

It's a truly great film. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. I remember at one point noticing how hard my heart was beating and thinking to myself that no movie had ever made my heart beat so hard. The fact that people wouldn't see how good this movie is shows how little they appreciate film and everything that goes into a project like this.

Everything about this movie is well done. The writing/story. The acting. The directing. The cinematography. The production.

I remember at one point in the film when a fight scene is going on in the sewer and it was dark obviously because it was a sewer, but the cinematographer had done the lighting so perfectly so that one could follow the fight 100% without it straining the eyes. In fact that scene looked really good. And this is the type of thing that people who have no real knowledge of film won't see when they see this movie. For people who don't know what actually goes into film making, they can't possibly evaluate it accurately.

The film also has 4 really great actors in it who deliver good performances. And the film has a really great build up and climactic peak at the end, with a really great ending. It's definitively a 10 in my book. I can't see anything about it that isn't well done. In fact I think this is a modern classic.",10,1,1

Yami sadly was main lead and her role was most confusing. She had to be brave, journalist, vulnerable and she get connected to the antagonist due to her father.

Film was too repetitive and unnecessary songs were introduced which did nothing but were irritating. At times you too give up with Yami that film will remain bleak with unnecessary introduction of unnecessary plots. Most hilarious was the ending when you hear lecture which was more repulsive as you know how whole plot that was built has been collapsed and now director wants to save himself by telling the viewer how you have been made sucker.

Movie premiered on Zee5 from 16th February 2023.

After the blockbuster movie ""Pink"", the director is back with an investigative thriller.

People get lost in the gimmicks of the politics --- A one line view post watching the movie

Plot of the Movie

Ishan a theatre - street play actor gone missing & the story comes to the Vidhi Sahani the daring journalist & she is on a mission to find the ""LOST"" guy & what happens during the course of her journey forms the rest part of the movie.

Movie Analysis 1) If the movie Pink was against the women safety and freedom , here Aniruddha talks about the negative shade of the politics & so the parallel politics in his own way. Writer Shyamal Sengupta , & co writer director had just given again a reminder to the society when politics plays dirty games , even the wisest lost themselves which then becomes a helix kind of state for them.

2) Kolkata had always been the best places for the Bollywood thriller. Kahaani & now Lost, as it always takes the audience with the story & it makes us a feel that the protagonist is not just alone to solve the mission.

3) Yami Gautham had given cent percent justification to the role. Her anxiousness , her curiosity , her hunger to know the truth , Yami able to portray well at the right time which didn't made the audience feel over rated.

4) There was a romance but that doesn't overshadowed the main plot thereby not loosing the gravity of the same.

5) Pankaj Kapur, Rahul Khanna who were having a larger screen presence had given a notable performance.

6) One negative which I felt , after a certain point , the movie was not able to continue as they want so the screenplay was twisted around the protagonist which made little painful.

But overall, a decent thriller movie. Another notable movie in Yami's filmography.",8,0,1

550,550,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,20-Jan-22,A collection of bricks.,"Though 'IMDb' lists 'The House (2022)' as a TV series*, 'Netflix' presents it as a feature-length affair and plenty of online sources (including 'Wikipedia' and several reputable film critics) refer to it as a movie. As such, I'm going to consider it a feature film, making it the first film I've seen that was initially released in 2022. It's also worth noting that, although its three stories exist more or less in isolation from one another, the thing feels like a cohesive experience that presents a few different interpretations of its central concept (so it's better suited to a movie than a mini-series, in my opinion). The first flick of the year is usually a bit subpar, but this is far from such. It's actually pretty great. The piece is an anthology of stop-motion animation that tells three distinct stories, each of which surround the eponymous house regardless of the fact that they're separated by many years and, even, the species of creature they focus on. The fact that the three stories star humans, rats and cats respectively can be interpreted in a few ways. Firstly, the changes in species could be entirely stylistic, meaning that the characters are represented by humans, rats and cats but are actually always one of the three (perhaps whichever you most connect with). Secondly, the timeline could be entirely linear and be set over a couple of thousand years rather than a couple of hundred, with giant rats at some point overthrowing humans before then themselves being overthrown by giant cats. The third possibility is that the house transcends conventional boundaries of space and time, occupying several different realities (across which these three stories take place). This aspect of the picture isn't particularly important and is certainly open to interpretation, like most of the narrative's surrealist events. It isn't so much a straightforward plot as it is a sort of unsettling mood poem. Even though the three stories are written by the same person, they feel wildly different in terms of tone and theme. Even their aesthetics are unique, the loose wool of the first segment contrasting sharply with the crisp fibres of the last. The segments compliment each other, though. In a way, they each start with the same concept and take it in their own direction, which makes for a consistently compelling watch. The first segment is, for me, the highlight, with a genuinely creepy atmosphere and a wonderfully moody aesthetic. There's something almost intangible about it and it often makes you smile because of how confidently bizarre it is. It feels like 19th century gothic horror, even if it's a lot more surreal than most entries in that genre, and it's certainly the most conventionally disquieting short in the film. The second segment has a surprisingly effective final moment, though, which is all the more startling because most of this story plays out like a pseudo 'kitchen sink' drama about an uncannily realistic renovator. As a result, it's actually rather scary as a whole. Its down-to-earth central performance and its nuanced animations make it feel remarkably true to life despite the fact that it features talking rodents. This is actually one of the things that makes it get under your skin, since it feels so strangely familiar and stressfully alien all at once. The moments of genuine comedy (largely absent from the first story) also add to this effect. The picture's third segment is very light on horror, more or less whittling its scares down to the gnawing realisation that the protagonist has been trapped by her own domesticity. It's a different sort of horror and it plays out more like a drama for most of its duration. Its hopeful ending is also tinged with a dash of sadness; perhaps it's too good to be true? Despite not being creepy, the final movement is still effective and engaging. Overall, this is a really solid animated horror film. Its aesthetic is gorgeous and its concepts are oddly engrossing. It isn't terrifying, but it is unsettling and it has the ability to provoke real retrospection. It's an entertaining affair from start to finish. 7/10.

*'IMDb' has subsequently altered the movie's page, which means that 'The House (2022)' is now correctly labelled as a film rather than a TV show.",7,1,1
551,551,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,15-Jan-22,A Visual Labyrinth: Perfect Mix of Lynch-Svankmajer-Kafkaesque Atmosphere,"I just finished my first 2022 title, and it was hypnotically weird ""The House"" streaming on Netflix and produced by Nexus Studios, i can't recommend it enough. It is wildly ambitious triptych, which uses stop motion animation to explore peculiar inhabitants in a house through different periods of time and worlds. All the stories take place at the same house, across different eras exploring the theme of home, capitalism, existential crisis, dreams and emptiness as the living are reduced to inanimate entities.

In Emma de Swaef & Marc James Roels opening act, ""And Heard Within. A Lie Is Spun,"" it is a gothic tale with all the classic haunted house genre troupes. We follow the Raymond family who abandon their modest lifestyle and relocate to a luxurious mansion nearby, it belongs to Van Schoonbeek, a mysterious and faceless architect. What follows is the supernatural drama which is developed in a very interesting labyrinth like narrative. There are so many moments but everything is presented with an indispensable horror subtext. Even the furniture and the mundanity of Raymond family does accentuate the atmosphere of the film. It is normal but disturbing with eerie soundtrack by Gustavo Santaolalla. My pick and my favourite in this three-part anthological film.

The second chapter, directed by Niki Lindroth von Bahr's is titled ""Then Lost is Truth that Can't be Won,"" set in the modern world, at the centre of the story is an anthropomorphic rat. He is now the developer for the Van Schoonbeek's estate and desperately hopes for a good buyer. He is disillusioned with the way his life unfolds and is bombarded with calls from the bank. He is enthusiastic about the unannounced visit of a couple who show interest to buy the house but later finds out their motive. This leads to all sorts of miscommunication and strife with the strange visitors. From there, a Kafkaesque labyrinth is built based on the home invasion genre and it is impossible for the protagonist to recover. The existential crisis increases with the passing of days, it turns out the person (darling) who he speaks over phone is his dentist. He is plagued by bugs and in the midst of all the stuff, there is Busby Berkeley-esque dance number for the vermin. It is funny and sad but never taking itself too seriously but reveals the obsession which cost the protagonist everything. In order to not give away everything, i don't want to reveal much.

The concluding chapter, directed by Paloma Baeza ""Listen Again and Seek The Sun"" is set in a post-apocalyptic flooded wasteland and the setting serves as the backdrop for the Van Schoonbeek estate. A fed-up landlady (Rosa) has to put up with the antics of her laid back tenants - Jen and Elias who never pay their rent in money but through crystal stone and fish. Jen is visited by her partner Cosmos and this irks Rosa. Nevertheless, she agrees to offer accommodation in return to restore the dilapidated house. This decision turns the life of the landlady completely upside down resulting in a bittersweet ending. This chapter is a hodgepodge and doesn't seem to fit with the tone of the previous two. It also blends humour and emotion well with little room for surrealism.

Minor quibbles aside, i'm happy that Netflix backed this experiment. I was surprised when a niche series like Brand New Cherry Flavor was sold to the mainstream. I was so impressed with The Summit of the Gods (2021) and The Mitchells vs. The Machines (2021). I hope they can assemble many more such experiments and balance it with a commercially clickbait titles too.

Overall, If you are into stop-motion animation, this is a must watch. Those who can appreciate surrealism from a purely visual point of view, i bet you won't be disappointed by this film. If you happen to love this, i recommend a list of underrated filmmakers who have some amazing stop motion titles to their credit: Lee Hardcastle, Robert Morgan, Christiane Cegavske, Jirí Barta, Regina Pessoa, Suzan Pitt, Tadanari Okamoto, Tomoki Misato, Izabela Plucinska, Siqi Song, Daria Kashcheeva, Jan Balej, Dave Borthwick, Martha Colburn, Phil Tippett, Cesar Cabral, Katariina Lillqvist, Takeshi Yashiro, Jirí Trnka, Brothers Quay, Len Lye, Anna Solanas, Bruce Bickford, Marc Riba, Jan Lenica, Keita Kurosaka, Ujicha, Joaquín Cocina and Cristobal Leon worth checking out in that regards.",7,1,1
552,552,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,15-Jan-22,Interesting take on a horror,"The stop animation is definitely beautiful. There was a lot of attention to detail and love poured into it.

The story itself was interesting. The first chapter has that mystery olden horror into it, and I kinda thought it would play out more twisty then what we actually got.

Second chapter was both hilarious and sad, with kinda a fitting ending.

The third chapter was also well done. Helena Bonham Carter was a gem in it.

Overall the story and theme can be interpreted in anyway or taken straight as a whole story. Definitely didn't regret watching this movie. Hoping they make more with more twisty story.",8,1,1

It's a very interesting and charming film anthology of stop-animation. The three stories and characters are all unique and distinct from one another except for this house that ties them together. The animation is excellent, the score is solid, and the stories engaging and thought provoking. I total surprise delight for me.",7,1,1
554,554,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,14-Jan-22,The House Is Netflix's Most Underrated Film,"The House is a brand new three part film that spans over 4 directors and an hour and 40 minutes. When I first watched the trailer for this film I knew it was going to be something different. While Netflix has certainly picked it up with its original movies the past few years I knew this was going to be like nothing we had seen before. Oh was I right

Chapter one is directed by Emma De Swaef, Marc James Roels and written by Enda Walsh and it is nothing short of one of the creepiest things I've watched. All 3 episodes/ Chapters are set around this house (who would've guessed) in these episodes we get to see the effect the house puts on people. I'm not going to go into to much detail as I want you experience this movie and all it has to offer yourself. Chapter one is based around a family of four in the 1800's as they move into this house they are being offered by a mysterious benefactor. Every episode is somewhat ominous and creepy and this episode has its parts. A Great unique art style paired with music from Gustavo Santaolalla and which reminds me of one of my favorite shows Over the garden wall makes for a fantastic and pretty scary movie. I was originally planning on watching this at 3 Am when it was released. I'm glad that I was tired and instead watched it in the morning. It's a tale that teaches us that Wants and Desires are not always what's best for us.

Chapter 2 which is directed by Niki Lindroth von Bahr does the art style the most justice as this episode is filled with absolute nightmare fuel. Set in the present day this chapter follows a Property Developer who has almost everything go wrong. This episode is absolutely terrifying. Their is one scene in particular that is so incredibly freaky that still while writing this review is one of the only things I can think of.

Chapter 3 is directed by Paloma Baeza and is the episode that makes you feel the most emotion. Despite the last two episodes being so freaking creepy something about this episode made me feel this absolutely gut wrenching and almost heart wrenching feeling that I don't think I can explain. Set in the near future where the world has been flooded it follows a Young Landlady trying to restore the house to its former glory. It's a tale of letting go of the past and moving on. The absolute almost fear I felt during this chapter is insane. It's the least ""scary"" of the three yet it resonated with me at such a level where I felt indescribable emotion.

I can't go to in-depth as I don't want to spoil anything but this movie is so strange yet it is so insanely good. This movie definitely isn't going to be for everyone but if the trailer intrigued you or if this review made you want to watch it, please do.",7,1,1
555,555,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,16-Jan-22,"Creepy, fun and heartwarming","This film contains 3 different and rather unique tales. First off I'd like to say - it's a very weird piece so it's not gonna be for everyone, and on Netflix it says 13+ but definitely don't watch it with children if you don't want to traumatise them. I'd say it's 16+ at the very least. It's not gory or violent by any means but it can be unsettling and very eerie at times, especially the first story. Now onto the review..

First: the creepy

This one is about how people tend to give themselves up for social expectations/money and the unmatiralistic purity of children. Its a rather sad tale but above everything it's an unsettling one. It's atmosphere is very eerie and to me it was visually, it looks like the distorted version of an old European cartoon, it sent chills down my spine the entire time, and though the story is kind of predictable, it managed to keep menon my toes. 8/10

Second: the fun

I couldn't quite grasp what this one was about, and to me this was the least entertaining out of the three. However it was quirky with a fun sense of humour so overall I did enjoy it. This one was interesting visually as well but it didn't stand out as much.

Side note/warning - if you have a fear of bugs you'll hate this one. 6/10

Third: the heartwarming

This story had a rather positive message about letting go of one's fear of change, taking a leap of faith instead of fixating on the past and the routines. It had a very nice/interesting atmosphere and it felt very humane to me. It was visually pleasing but nothing really unique. It's a nice closure to the previous stories, by the end it leavs the wiever with a good taste in yotheir mouth. 9/10.",8,1,1
556,556,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,21-Jan-22,Beautifully looking and pretty entertaining,"I hate this house.

Three stories that are only related through the same house.

What impressed me the most was the cinematography and music. Even though it's an animation, the camera shots and lightning was incredible. The music amplified the frustration from the characters and made me feel uneasy about the house. Aesthetically this movie was beautiful.

The art style also made the house felt like a character: even though it's beautiful on the outside, it's all sort of weirdness on the inside. This led to the absurd yet entertaining stories. They all started with a situation that could happen in real life, but then became exaggerated metaphorically. The second story was my favorite. It sure was nasty, but also ridiculous and funny.

Overall, it's a well-crafted and bizarre piece of work. This is what art-house cinema is haha. 7.5/10.",7,1,1

558,558,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,14-Jan-22,Stunningly beautiful,"This film is one of the most well-crafted films I have ever seen. Every single frame is so precise in the details. I really hope that other filmmakers are inspired by this type of creativity, and use this styling in their own films.

The stories themselves were weirdly unsettling, and although I wouldn't classify it as a horror, many elements seemed as though they were inspired from some nightmarish dream. Although I am sure many audiences will find that they prefer a certain ""story"" (or generation) above the others - as each story seems to be specifically catered to a certain demographic - each story is unique in its story telling and compelling enough to make you keep watching.

I highly recommend this film, it is a great watch and surely worth your time. It is much better than 95% of the current content on Netflix by far.",9,1,1

This series may not be for everyone but it is certainly entertaining, stressful, beautiful, sad, funny, all while making it wonderful. Well done Netflix!",9,1,1
560,560,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,26-Jan-22,An uneven but well animated stop motion anthology,"A three story house serves as the centerpiece of three stories. The first follows a poor family who are given a new home constructed by an enigmatic benefactor only to find out all too late that the house is still under construction and more a prison-like labyrinth than a home. The second follows a struggling developer who due to economic pressures, pest infestations, and miscommunications finds himself in an uphill battle to refurbish and showcase the home to potential buyers, only for two such potential buyers to become overly familiar with the house. The third follows a struggling landlord who tries to keep the house a float (literally) after a flood has driven off most of the tenets leaving only a collection of eccentric deadbeats as her last loyal tenets.

The House is a British stop-motion anthology film featuring three segments done by a different team of directors and animators. Produced at Nexus Studios for Netflix's streaming service, the film features a collection of tales surrounding the titular house that run the gamut from Edgar Allen Poe inspired gothic macabre, dark as black comedy, or even whimsical magic realism. While the stories vary in terms of quality, they form a mostly satisfying whole and create a weird but memorable experience.

The animation is well done with each animation team giving their segment their own visual identity while tying into the central linking device of the house. The segments are all visually appealing with their unique styles with the first segment's character designs and environments matching the bleak and depressing atmosphere created, while the other two shorts focus on anthropomorphic characters such as mice and cats who play their stories a bit more for humor (albeit quite dark).

The House sets the bar high for itself with its first story, And heard within, a lie is spun, playing itself as a gothic horror story where a family of lower class is given what seems like the deal of a lifetime as they come into possession a seemingly attractive house only for the grandiosity and opulence to be taken to ludicrous extremes that soon become horrific in nature and concept. It creates a solid feeling of creeping dread and has the air of if Poe had given his take on the Winchester Mystery House. While this opening segment is quite amazing, the following segments kind of pale in comparison to it. Not that they're bad or anything as there's still some solid work in the animation and artwork with the Fur Beetle dance and the final sequence delivering some truly amazing sights, but their stories didn't really resonate the way the first part did. The plots of the last two segments are also pretty similar with both dealing with a protagonist who is trying to rebuild the house (though one by unwilling obligation and the other doing so of their own volition) and also dealing with unwanted ""guests"" who curtail their plans (with one set malevolent and the other set benevolent). The segments have some really strong elements and themes but they never really reached the level of the first short (at least for me anyway).

The House is an ambitious stop-motion anthology with strong animation and memorable imagery. While it starts with its best story and continues with two okay stories, as a showcase for solid stop-motion animation that carries a sharp edge The House truly is home.",7,1,1

562,562,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,21-Jan-22,Not... good enough.,"65/100

The House is actually a miniseries that was grouped into a feature film and announced as a Netflix special... and that isn't even the most confusing aspect of it.

Normally, when a movie revolves around more than one storyline, one of them will always outshine the others. With The House, it is no different. I guess that that was my biggest trouble with it, my harshest critique -since most of my problems with it could just be problematic nitpicks-. What I anticipated for worse pretty much happened the way I was expecting it to and the movie was indifferent at proving me otherwise.

All three stories suffer from the exact same thing: they feel entirely detatched from each other. The only moment where they reference the preceding story is by a minute reference that, if you were to only watch one of the three, you wouldn't even notice. What I am agitated with is that each story has ENTIRE scenes left unpurposed. It would've been interesting to see these stories have a sense of continuity since they all reside within the same house. It feels contradictory to push them all together with a ""Film"" tag attatched to it if they were to be this disconnected from each other in the first place.

The animation, though I have a soft spot for stop motion since it's the art medium that takes the most time and effort, sometimes doesn't match with the dialogue delivered by the voice cast. This wasn't entirely a problem since the film itself has a good camera understanding, leading to some up-to-par shots. The writing can sometimes feel awful since it doesn't establish enough information for us to process on account of each story's short runtime and the character design of the first story just feels off since the only purpose it contains is that of creating a confining atmosphere.

I guess I was expecting more, not only from my first ever movie released this year, but also for a movie that feels ambitious enough to be considered arthouse, but not good enough for the lack of initiative.",6,0,0
563,563,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,20-Jan-22,Rewarding Watch,"""For those who decide not to find it, there can be nothing.""

Across different eras, a poor family, an anxious developer and a fed-up landlady become tied to the same mysterious house in this animated dark comedy. The House is an interesting 90 minutes that's hard to describe. Over the course of three segments we watch this setting grow into this surreal experience. With how strange this is, not everyone will be all for it. Even some parts within the segments didn't necessarily work for me. Still, the entirety pays off well in the end. The most striking feature is the use of stop motion animation. This style has become almost a lost art. Hardly any filmmakers use it anymore with the convenience of computer animation. There's something about it that I love and thankfully they chose to go that route here. With the route these stories take, only an animated style could do it justice. Plus, people are weirded out by stop motion animation and claymation so it only seems fitting. The entire atmosphere is expertly crafted by our four directors. Having a different director for each gives a unique approach each time. Because of that decision, the flow of the entirety doesn't always match. Though it's listed as three separate episodes, Netflix put them together in one to make it a movie. That's slightly confusing because having a set thing, episodic or movie, would give a better idea of what this project should be. I'm sure there's an answer somewhere.

We have a wide array of voice acting from veteran actors. It's fun to spot each voice within the shorts. Mia Goth is in the first and does an excellent job with her character. Jarvis Cocker has his performance in the second, being my favorite acting performance of them all. And in the third, I was a big fan of everyone. However, Helena Bonham Carter and Susan Wokoma stand out the most. As for each episode, it's hard to rank them because they're all so different. The first caught my attention, especially in the third act from how strange it turned out to be. The second is frustrating, taking inspiration from mother!. And the final is bittersweet invoking a feeling of home and loss. The third has the most to say and has stuck with me the most. I would be interested to see a feature length of each. The pacing doesn't always work with them partially from how short they are, even if they are slow burns. And the story doesn't always come through as much as it could. Still, The House manages to pull everything together and be a notable feature/series (I'll find out sometime) that could be memorable till the end of the year and years to come.

The movie is actually an anthology with three episodes set in the same house, in different decades and with different types of characters. The first chapter is the best one, with a fully thought-out concept that is clichéd but very effective. The ending is somewhat unsatisfying, leaves the viewer wanting for more in the same way watching a movie trailer does.

The second episode is wayy less effective. Thematically and plot-wise, there seems to be no connection between the episodes. Worse than that, the ideas they seem to have wanted to explore feel only hinted at. After the second episode, I just gave up. Overall, first chapter is worth watching if only for the spooky atmosphere and engaging story. The second chapter destroys whatever promise the first one showed.

570,570,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,14-Jan-22,"Darkly Funny, Yet Horrific Saga Of A Very Strange House (Mild Spoilers)","One of the best animation films I've seen. All 3 parts are very competently directed, and the animation captures even subtle movements extremely well. The voice actors deserve special mention for being uniformly excellent. The story begins with a story set in what seems to be late Victorian England, with a mysterious man promising much to a young family without asking anything in return. The voice actors , Mia Goth and Eleanor De Swaef are so extremely sweet and expressive in this segment. The atmosphere is deeply unsettling and reminiscent of a story by E F Benson or Algernon Blackwood.

It leads into the second one , with a tonal shift regarding the time period. It deals with a young, harried developer trying to create this showpiece-type home to sell. The building is in shambles but he keeps trying to paper over the cracks. While this seemed a bit gimmicky compared to the first, what it shows and what it reveals will leave you thinking for days after. Though one of the scenes made me wonder if the director was hinting at an immigrant intrusion, and I hope not, because it is a brilliant short otherwise. The third one is far more benign on the surface than the others and seems to hint at a happy ending, but then this house is not what it seems. This part had some beautiful scenes in the end on par with a Ghibli movie.

571,571,The House,6.8,Animation Comedy Drama,16-Jan-22,"Overall entertaining, but the first story is the strongest","Set across different time periods and worlds, The House features three separate short stories that all revolve around one grand manor house and the many strange goings on that happen there.

The first ""And Heard Within. A Lie is Spun"" tells a wonderfully dark Shining-style horror where the house itself is an evil, cosmic entity that slowly imprisons and consumes its inhabitants. The fact that the characters are wool puppets does not make what happens any less terrifying; there are some truly nightmarish moments and I think it could easily have been a standalone feature.

The second story jumps to the modern day, in which an anthropomorphic rat is attempting to refurbish and sell the house to wealthy buyers. In his way are plumbing problems...and some large bugs. This one was more comical, but in an off kilter 'something weird is going to happen' way which keeps the suspense going.

The third story is the weakest in my opinion. Set in what I presume is a post-climate change future, the house is surrounded by floodwater while a landlord cat tries to reign in her unruly hippie tenants. I thought there was probably some sub textual commentary going on about society needing to abandon capitalism and embrace a utopic socialist ideal in the face of rising sea-levels, but it's very vague, albeit charmingly acted and animated.

I do wish the stories were better linked; While the house is the same in all three stories, they don't reference each other; In the first film the building is almost sentient, whereas in the other two it's just bricks and mortar. There's no common lore that links the house from film to film, which I think was a missed opportunity. That said, each film was brilliantly executed in its own right and it's great to see Netflix embracing animation that is not afraid to tell quirky, left-of-field stories.",7,1,1

I see some people criticising the plot or the script. Well, the plot is good IMO. For a film that happens in one night I think it touches in many things and isn't even politically correct (a lot of the spectators would have preferred to blame only the police because for them is always white and black). The script is...honestly, good enough? Yeah, some dialogue is not that great, but what do you think would be the real dialogue in a situation like this one?

The guy urges for calm. But before we know it, someone throws a Molotov cocktail into the police station, and it sets into motion the looting of the police station... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from French director Romain Gavros, best known for shooting edgy music videos. Here Gavros brings the fictional tale of a suburban (filmed in a Paris banlieue) uprising following yet another instance of police brutality. While fictional, it feels all too familiar of course. Heads up: the opening sequence that lasts about 10 minutes is insanely intense, and... brought in a single take. In fact the long takes are a recurring feature in the film (I honestly don't know how some of these shots are even possible). The movie's tension is palpable from the get-go and really doesn't let up. The no-names cast is quite good, in particular the main character Abdel, played by French-Algerian actor Dali Bensallah. Bottom line: this revenge crime drama grabbed my attention from start to finish. But if intensive and over the top violence is not your thing, better stay away.

""Athena"" premiered earlier this month at the Venice film festival to positive buzz. It started airing on Netflix this weekend. After seeing a positive write-up in Friday's New York Times, I just had to check it out. Glad I did.

This movie is one long BATTLE between French youth in the suburbs of Paris and the police. It's shot in a war style kind of way, with claustrophic scenes of contineous, intense FIGHTiNG inside and outside of crumbling, highrise appartment buildings in these poor French neighbourhoods.

The intensity of this story is FIERCE. It just doesnt light up. The acting performances are on STEROIDS, with a constant crazed drive in the eyes of the leading characters, who are out of control by RAGE because of the fact that their friend and brother got KILLED by the police.

The photography is a constant WAVE of rushes of ATTACKS through narrow streets and corridors, often filmed on the back of rioters, who are being followed in close up, while fireworks are constantly exploding all around them, which makes this movie even more intense. The sound score is as CLAUSTROPHOBIC and intense as the photography.

This movie has got the look and feel of a real live WAR documentary. It's contineous adrenaline RUSH is breathtaking.

I tried to find out if this story was actually based on real events, but I could not find any information about it in detail. I will add details later on if I find out more about this story...

What makes watching this movie so breathtakingly painful and worrisome is that many similar riots have occurred in France over the last 15 years.

What impresses me most of all is the cameradirection and continous shots made possible due to tip of the top logistical management and a top inspired director when you are practically inside the riots, and each longshot sequence follows one out of 4 important caracters, 3 brothers and a antiriotpoliceman. There are many sections where the individual acting is outstanding, but mostly it is the multitude of people that makes this films caracter

its a lot of violent running and screaming, shooting and looting desperate young guns that demands, and the plot doesnt differ much from the real stuff weve seen since passing year 2000 in france, with ghetto/suburbian riots against politics and police, and not nessesarily just hudlums and crooks, reality shows that the average low income french citizen also grabs a stone when the dire straits.

Im just complaining a little on the prolouge to the actions taken, its hints given but not enough to light the same flame in my sole. But the immensity on the production quality and filmographic management demands 10 stars from the grumpy old man.

The story line was weak. They had a great plot to be honest. And they could have done so much more. It would have been a tear jerker but unfortunately they didn't maximize the plot. The only thing good was the camera that they used to shoot this movie. The movie lacked greatly. Just flashing lights, fireworks and a lot of shouting and fighting. If that's what it takes to make a great movie. A lot of movies would have been awesome. Like I said the plot had potential.

But too numerous are the drawbacks that come to corrupt the whole movie, and especially when it comes to the content of it.

The acting is very disturbing, sometimes a bit too far from natural reactions, too focused on the script, too played like in theatres not enough realistic as a true movie needs.

As for the content, that's a very checkered issue to showcase that, it says a lot on what these directors want and imagine - a war. That's true to say that there is such a conflict between youngsters from the French hood and police as La Haine showed before, but the dimension is exaggerated, staging these youngsters as true warriors, beating the asses of police which is as we all know not the case - American gang movies know it perfectly.

Briefly, that's a bit awkward to see that, especially when you grow up in these places. However, let's consider that as a cinematic progress on the style, but it's clear that scripts are written by French bourgeois, not people from that place, that the story is written by a the biased opinion of a French bourgeois unashamed of showing that face of the hood: a place of war before a place of nice people, not objective people.",5,-1,0

It tries to portray a gritty and chaotic realism but fails to live up these ordeals by blending fantastical elements alongside unsophisticated plot writing and character development.

Expecting more going into this and came away disappointed due to the constant use of tropes, unrealistic characters and dialogue. Substance is replaced by chanting and an unlimited supply of fireworks.

First of al good things: visuals!!! Piece of art, starting from first scene all the way to the very last moments of film.

Secondly very good acting by leading roles, although unrealistic emotions at some moments ruined truly epic performance. You could definitely see a lot of talent here, but really bad script, so many plot holes, mistakes and goofs. Shortly speaking film started with somewhat around 8.5 and then steadily going down. No deeper meaning or cliffhangers definitely didn't save overall poor film. 6 is being very generous and only because pros I've mentioned was at high level.",6,-1,0

So no pun intended - at least not from my side of things. Athena was (or is, if the Greek Gods still live but are just forgotten) the Goddess of Justice. The name is also the name of a building - but again Gavras of Greek descent knows why he chose that name.

You do not have to know this to to enjoy the movie - or understand it in any shape or form. You will be able to understand the rage - the disappointment. You may not agree with how that is channeled and used ... violence begets violence. There is a vicious circle ... and maybe if you agree you may think there is no other way to make people understand ... to actually get results ... but is it really helping? Whatever the case may be - the movie is powerful. Visually and otherwise ... the long shots are amazing to say the least. The effects are spot on - again no pun intended.

If you are a fan already you do not need more convincing ... but Gavras seems to have learned or rather got it from his father (are we talking legacy here?) ... well done! No pun intended.",9,1,1

Athena indeed stands out for its cinematography and tackiness. The movie is a continuous virtuosity with the camera, explosions of colours and action scenes. Unfortunately, however, it fails in the writing, especially of the three main characters, whose actions and behaviour completely lose sense around the middle of the film, sacrificed for the quest for spectacularity. The message the director wants to give loses power because of this, and as a result of his reticence to take a real stand, something exemplified in the rather disappointing and defensive final twist.",6,-1,0

Filled with political and social criticism relating to France's colonial past and present day issues which might be missed by an international audience, yet if you don't you'll easily place them into your own location.

I appreciate the effort to not make it a plainly left or right wing view but to showcase the humanity in each character. On each side of the aisle, even in the cops. Appreciate the scenes reminding of the storming of the bastille, ancient greek myth and dramatic battle scenes, that somehow manage to fit into a concrete city block in france.

I have respect for the movie, yet i understand that it isn't for everyone. It's more art, more fable, than dramatic action thriller. Although it's beautifully filmed.

Highly recommend watching it in french. Even if you don't speak french like me. The voices speak so much more.",9,1,1
588,588,Athena,6.8,Action Drama Thriller,26-Jan-23,A fiery and pulse-pounding thriller,"A collaboration with French filmmaker Ladj Ly, who co-writes this Netflix released dramatic thriller after he bought the incendiary Les Miserables to our screens a few years ago, Romain Gavras's impressively shot Athena is an above average direct to streaming release that showcases why Gavras should be a director to keep a very close eye on.

Famed in the industry for his work in the commercial and music clip space, with his previous features Notre jour viendra and The World is Yours not really pushing his brand forward in a significant way, Gavras rollicks out of the block with Athena, offering up a 10 minute plus one-shot opening segment that will take your breath away as we are flung headfirst into the chaotic world of a trio of brothers who find themselves in life and death situations on both sides of the law after their youngster brother is killed by a group of French policeman.

It's hard to properly put into words just how well-staged and constructed this opening stanza of Athena is but for all it's qualities, it sets a standard that the film can't quite maintain throughout its brisk 90 minute run-time as Gavras manages to continually impress us with his visual prowess and verve but in a storytelling sense there's a feeling that there's not a lot going on under the surface as a deeper meaning to care or grow attached to those that inhabit Athena's world is unable to be discovered.

There's an undeniable tension to almost every one of Athena's scenes, many that take place in a longer take format and some of the films most white knuckle moments bring to memory films such as Uncut Gems, La Haine and Ladj Ly's own previously mentioned Les Miserables but there's an inescapable feeling and sense that as the tale of Dali Benssalah's militaristic Abdel, Sami Slimane's determined Karim and Ouassini Embarek's gun dealing Moktar goes on, the gaps in Athena's narrative become more apparent and hold Gavras's film back from becoming the special something it threatens to be on more than one occasion.

Weighed up against Netflix's usual products there's no doubt that Athena would rank in the upper class of content the streaming giant has put their name to in recent years and considering the technical mastery and excitement Gavras manages to instil into his effort here, there's no doubt going to be a moment where the French filmmaker knocks something out of the park in a big way.

Final Say -

Opening up with all guns blazing in an unforgettable start, Athena doesn't manage to hold the momentum all the way through its running time but for those seeking a fresh and baggage free affair, Romain Gavras film provides much in the way of entertainment and spectacle.

It's a visual spectacle with a brilliant atmosphere, beautiful cinematography and truly bone cracking fight scenes, our main character, Abdel, is brilliant, Dali Benssalah put on a truly raw and powerful performance perfectly portraying the pain we all felt during the time of violence and riots.

The musical score is absolutely wonderful, wow, it's some of the best I've heard since Causeway, Athena manages to give us a driven character story while also having a somewhat breathtaking ending to pull it all together, and I'm proud to say I loved it.

Athena gets an A-",8,1,1
590,590,Athena,6.8,Action Drama Thriller,22-Dec-22,If Justice's Stress Became a Movie,"Athena is a bleak, almost dystopian look at the near future of France, a country familiar with racial tensions. We follow three brothers: Karim, a revolutionary leader of the community in revolt, Athena (Salimane), Abdel, a respected military man (Dessalah), and Moktar, a drug dealer (Embarek), as they reel from the death of their brother Idir, at the hands of police.

The death, supposedly the third in one month, leads to an uprising reminiscent of the 1871 Paris Commune, where the city essentially seceded from France for a year. Athena follows the chaos and starts with possibly the best intro of 2022: a blistering, intense one take that introduces the movie with an incredible bang. It's so good I've watched the intro itself three times.

But Athena doesn't let up from there; this isn't a movie that bogs itself down in drama and conversation. It's high octane, kinetic, and a feast for the senses. This is a gorgeous movie; the cinematography so perfectly captures the chaos and finds beauty in it. There are literal shots from this movie that I could see being album covers. The music is epic; orchestral mixed with booming synth that gives this very contemporary story a timelessness. It's as if we're watching an ancient siege take place in the 21st century. I can't gush enough about the amazing music, especially that sinister main theme.

The performances are also excellent; Salimane and Dessalah in particular convey a lot with their facial expressions; I fully understood the dynamics of their complicated relationship even though they shared the screen together quite briefly.

When I first watched Athena, I was a bit disappointed by the lack of substance to the story; while we get clues as to why the anger that is displayed in the film - the anger of immigrant communities vis a vis their interactions with the police in suburban Paris - the world we're entering isn't *fully* disclosed to us.

There are also some plot developments that I don't think make a ton of sense, and the movie begins to falter a bit for me by Act III. There's a plot development and we're sort of rushed into a the third act; the people I watched this movie with were shocked the movie was ending so quickly. It felt like we could've and should've gotten more.

But, the fact that I could watch this movie with others and know they'd be entertained is kind of a miracle. The French tend to make films about their society collapsing along racial and religious lines quite a bit. It's something I would never really expect to see from American filmmakers, and it's incredible to see it so often from France (I'm thinking of movies like Frontieres, Les Miserables etc.).

If you want to introduce audiences to French cinema, you really can't get better than Athena. It's an incredible, accessible, and very rewatchable movie. I highly recommend it, because I guarantee you're probably not going to see anything like it.",8,1,1

It's what raises the bar for an already complex, emotional and heartbreaking story. The performances are also impeccable. The protagonists have a performance very close to the limit of their capacities that contributes to the high tension the film exhibits almost in its entirety.

It's not a movie for everyone. You must have the mental and emotional capacity to endure the story, the actions and the outcome of the brothers.

It does bring to mind the claustrophobic presence of the French military in The Battle of Algiers , which depicts the French colonisation of Algiers.

The deeper connotations of hidden agents sowing chaos and discord in order to turn public opinion in their diabolical favour is poignant and topical. But even without acknowledging that deeper subtext, we're offered a gritty, intense look into the anger that fuels riots. There's no good guys in this story, only deeply flawed people acting and reacting to the situations they find themselves in, for good or bad. The constant use of long shots adds not only to the suspense of the film, but also the intimacy with its characters. Yet it also knows when to use more conventional editing in service of the story it needs to tell. Grief and pain hang in the hair thanks to the impactful score, and the acting is commendable especially from a handful of first-time actors. The dialogue is not as strong as it could've been, but that may also have just been a victim of subtitles, and its fundamental message gets lost and confused in the spectacle.

In the last shot its all brought back (along with a few other mentions along the way) to have begun with an act rasicm, which again doesn't make up for all the violence in any way, shape or form.

600,600,Kimi,6.3,Crime Drama Thriller,17-Feb-22,Fruitful yet incomplete,"Kimi is fruitful yet incomplete. First, the story introduces interesting ideas, but doesn't follow through. Zoe Kravitz's agoraphobic protagonist leads a confined life before stumbling upon a crime recorded on a home device. From there, Kravitz attempts to expose the crime, but she's met with a bureaucratic conspiracy. This premise establishes themes of captivity, surveillance, and systemic injustice. However, these subjects don't concretely pay off. Similarly, the acting is inconsistent. Kravitz optimizes the role, yet her material is one note. She adds layers but the script lacks a clear arc, stagnating her performance. Meanwhile, her supporting cast (besides Wilson) is weak.

Beyond Kravitz, Kimi's virtue is its filmmaking. The cast, production, and effects are sparse, but craftsmanship is potent. For example, the cinematography uses varied shots and compositions to keep entertainment high and emotions palpable. In Kravitz's apartment, overheads and extreme close-ups convey importance and maintain engagement. Outside, Dutch angles, unsteady movement, and confined spacing express intense anxiety. Plus, the editing efficiently matches Kravitz's mental state, the sound symbolically reflects her perspective, and the music is oddly fitting. Soderbergh gets plenty out of this limited project. Ultimately, Kimi has merit but isn't a must-see.

It has a runtime of about 1hr30 but it feels really short because a huge chunk of that time is spent exploring aspects of the movie that lead to nothing whilst leaving out huge gaping plot holes. Quite a cliche where the avaricious billionaire, or soon to be, is hiding a crime and a junior employee somehow gets the better of them.

I have no idea why that is because this is a good solid film.

Very much in line with Steven Soderbergh other films.

Keeping it simple. Good storytelling with thriller elements. You just know what you're getting with Soderbergh. Rounded characters, no Flash/bang CGI/visual effects to unnecessarily distract and a set of good actors in a well told story. It's like old film making techniques to tell modern stories.

It sort of reminded me of a modern version of Rear Window but with post covid lockdown as a backdrop and the use of modern information technology. It is substantially different to Rear window though.

This, I think, is the first Zoe Kravitz film I've seen. She's very good. Very believable.

What Soderbergh does, and I personally like this, is take modern topics of conversation and produces a story that weaves all that into a thriller of sorts.

He did this with ""No sudden move"" (corporate greed), ""the Laundromat"" (Panama papers), ""Unsane"" and ""side effects"" (the health sector), ""High flying bird"" (sport greed) and now with Kimi (data harvesting and big tech).

Sometimes he hammers home the point, but in this film, it's all laid out without being belligerent.

It's an intelligent technology based thriller (not techno thriller - which I associate with cyberpunk etc).

A great film to watch one evening. Good pacing and not too long.

There is a sexual scene in it, so if you are planning to watch it then You'll be alright if you have older teenage kids or non-prudish parents. If you can get past that, then you're onto a winner for a night's entertainment.

I appreciate somebody making it work and it fits the character. That's why I don't like the office section. It doesn't fit the character. She should try to go out and fail.

One of the biggest pros of Kimi is that it's not afraid to feels small. It IS a small thriller. The main concept is familiar and it can be really predictable at times. It's also not afraid to feels like a TV movie sometimes, using some filming techniques that we are not used to see in cinema big productions. But Kimi is also a film with a big heart, with a very good interpretation from Zoë Kravitz and also with time for a cool, exciting and funny third act.

607,607,Kimi,6.3,Crime Drama Thriller,10-Feb-22,A strong Rear Window-esque tech thriller brought to stylish life by Soderbergh's style and a strong performance by Zoe Kravitz.,"During the COVD-19 pandemic, tech worker Angela Childs (Zoe Kravitz) works for the Amygdala Corporation refining command streams for their virtual assistant KIMI with the primary selling point differentiating it from SIRI or Alexa being it's continuous review by human support staff so it can be refined and upgraded. Angela works from home having suffered from agoraphobia following an assault some years back, but maintains with her neighbor Terry Hughes (Byron Bowers) with the two having formed a romantic relationship during the COVD lockdown. During Angela's review of KIMI commands she comes across a command stream which has seemingly recorded what sounds like a murder of a woman (Erika Christensen). As Angela digs deeper into the stream she's met with resistance from Amygdala's corporate bureaucracy who worry about tainting their going public with a scandal and must now try to overcome her trauma to find who was killed and why.

KIMI marks the latest film from versatile director Steven Soderbergh and the latest original film for HBO Max following Soderbergh's previous efforts Let Them All Talk and No Sudden Move. Written and produced by noted screenwriter David Koepp, Koepp is in familiar territory having collaborated with David Fincher in 2002 on the home invasion thriller Panic Room that despite its familiar trappings won over critics and audiences with its directorial style and performances. While the movie takes a well-trodden format inspired by Hitchcock's Rear Window, Koepp gives the material a fresh spin that reminded me of the early 2000s Larry Cohen thrillers like Phone Booth and Cellular that took the emerging cell phone technology of the time and applied it to classic thriller tropes. What Larry Cohen did for Cell Phones, David Koepp does for the era of Alexa and Google Asssitant and I was honestly pretty engaged from start to finish.

Zoe Kravits is terrific in the role of Angela and much of the time, especially in the first hour, Angela is the only character we see directly as she interacts through the world primarily through text messaging, video conferencing, and phone calls. Kravitz does a good job of conveying a person who's suffered a past trauma and walled herself off in favor of a techological barrier that allows her to survive and work in the 21st Century, and the movie gives her a solid arc in her ""Hedgehog's Dilemma"" where's she's protected and fortified herself but has to learn to put down defenses and trust people and the world again. Kravitz and Byron Bowers have solid chemistry in their relationship and you feel Bowers frusturation with trying to be understanding of Angela's trauma while also trying to convince her to come outside her apartment with him. In addition to Bowers, the movie also features a solid supporting cast who appear throughout including David Wain, Andy Daly, Jacob Vargas, and a host of others who help sell the scenario put on screen.

Soderbergh does a great job crafting a modern day thriller whilst utilizing classic thriller tropes that can be traced to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Donen. While the movie does fall under the umbrella of ""Covid films"" we've seen with the likes of higher end (relatively speaking) films like Songbird or Locked Down to direct-to-video schlock like The Covid Killer or Corona: Fear Is a Virus, KIMI is the first one I feel actually works for the type of movie it's trying to be. Many of those movies mentioned even Songbird or Locked Down which had the resources of Michael Bay and Steven Knight often felt like rushed ""strike while the Iron's hot"" films designed to catch people with a timely premise and little else substantiating it. Soderbergh and Koepp feel like they utilize the Covid pandemic to tell a story and examine its impact upon a character, but it never feels like its timeliness is being used as a gimmick. Soderbergh brings his usually visual flair to the proceedings as he uses Steadicam when we're inside Angela's apartment, but once we're outside with Angela the filmmaking uses a handheld camera and a number of tilted shots to give a good visual sense of the tension and unease felt by Angela making for great visual storytelling. Koepp's script keeps a solid pace throughout its brisk 89 minute runtime, but you feel like you get to know the characters and the mystery quite well as we're very much placed in Angela's shoes. Admittedly the movie loses some of its tension after the hour mark when everything is ""laid out"" but that only means it goes from being great to being good, and even if the stuff in the last third pales in comparison to the first hour, it gives a deliciously entertaining pay-off to Angela's arc with some dark as black humor in how she utilizes the Kimi. Koepp's script is also a much less pessimistic and misanthropic take on the material than I've seen with other films that attempt this kind of thing. One standout sequence I loved was when two nameless thugs in a van try to kidnap Angela and some nearby homeless rights protestors block the van from escaping and pull her out of the van and help her to safety.

KIMI takes conventional thriller trappings and applies it to our modern day world without feeling like ""headlinesploitation"". With a solid script, great direction, and a fantastic performance by Zoe Kravitz, Soderbergh continues to show his strength as a versatile director taking what could've been an average thriller and elevating it with his style.",8,1,1

But the most unforgivable aspect is a gaping plot hole that would have ended the conflict as soon as it began. Call the cops. Movie over.

I tried ignoring it for a while. I figured they would make up an excuse like the cops being involved. It would be lazy, but at least it would be addressed.

Those characters around here, all of them, were pointless. And the baddies were laughable. To the point where the film turned into a dumb parody.

611,611,Kimi,6.3,Crime Drama Thriller,11-Feb-22,Mindless entertainment: the 90 min just flew by,"As ""Kimi"" (2022 release; 89 min.) opens, the CEO of the company that makes Kimi, an Alexa-reminding device, is doing a TV interview from his Seattle-based home. We then are introduced to know Angela, who works as a voice stream interpreter at that company, but working remotely due to COVID-19. It's not long before Angela picks up an audio file containing what appears to be an assault on a woman. At this point we are 10 min into the film.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Stephen Soderbergh, working from prolific David Koepp's latest script. The movie is plot-heavy so the less said about how this plays out, the better. My overall sense as I was watching this is that I was reminded on multiple occasions of Alfred Hitchcock. ""Rear View"" immediately comes to mind, but also the recurring theme of a single person accidentally becoming involved in something big. Of course the other underlying theme is the perils of ever more intrusive technology in today's society. Kudos to Zoe Kravitch for a great lead performance as Angela, as she caries the movie from beginning to end. Last but not least, the original score is by Cliff Martinez, the once super-prolific film composer wo is making his return after 4-5 years away. Bottom line: this turned out to be mindless entertainment and the hour and a half just flew by in no time.

""Kimi"" premiered last night on HBO Max (meaning, it's not even on HBO or HBO On Demand). Why such a low profile release, I have no idea. In any event, if you are in the mood for a decent thriller, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",7,1,1

Kimi doesn't do nearly as much as it could with its tech-spin premise on the conspiracy thriller, and it certainly is no untouchable masterpiece of character work. The script could have used a little more meat on its bones as it relates to character development and world building.

But what it does do is just enough. I found this film to be an extraordinarily efficient work of pacing. It's never so slow that it becomes boring; there's always something to pay attention to in every scene. And the second half of the film really becomes riveting with constant variety in location, physical threat, and power dynamics.

614,614,Kimi,6.3,Crime Drama Thriller,15-Feb-22,Soderbergh and Koepp still got it,"What a delicious auteurist recipe! Leave it to Steven Soderbergh and David Koepp to open up a pot and throw in chunks of Blow Out, some The Conversation, Rear Window, Hitchcock, Philip K D (or for you kids, maybe Black Mirror), a few grams of every Agoraphobia/OCD protagonist-led thriller and a squeeze of Home Alone (I mistakenly thought by the premise it could be their Inside but that's not quite the angle), not to mention the cooking energy of Koepp's own Panic Room, and yet with everything like that they manage to create a visually distinct and kinetic (but still coherent), very brisk, intense thriller that is about the times we're in. The camera and editing move things with a surefire pace while inside that apartment, and then once outside the tilted angle walking/running angles and movements give further evidence as to why Peter Andrews takes risks and they more often than not pay off.

And while Kravitz brings her A game to a character that requires a lot of pain and trauma and battling multiple mental illnesses and disorders, I was so impressed by the casting in the supporting roles, with Rita Wilson giving us everything to know who this woman is in less than five minutes, Ratray (you know, hes been in dozens of films and TV shows but he's always Buzz in, once again, Home Alone one and two), that one actor my wife got so excited about who was one of the leads in Jane the Virgin, and in particular Derek DelGaudio as the man who is so in deep s*** and causing all of this criming-and-paying-off in the first place (that is to say the same kind of concerned/serious countenance we got I one brilliant way in In and Of Itself is used in another in his few scenes).

And more than many other films I can think of in the past ten or so years, the themes of omnipresent surveillance, abuse and paranoia are amplified because it's not the future; it's not only here, but worse than many other films or stories anticipated decades ago. The pandemic is the backdrop, but it doesn't feel inconsequential to what's happening here either; all this time being Inside and everything in the world, one doesn't have to go so far to imagine, furthers and worsens the anxiety and negative parts that keeps Angela inside. It's also about how some of us (maybe even the director himself) can't not pay attention to the little details if we are surrounded by the things we are familiar with day in and day out - even, for sure, tooth aches.

This isn't to say some things aren't without criticism, like how little screentime we get with erika Christenen (we do understand what her function is in the film, just more of her would've been cool), and that the movie doesn't make it seem that difficult for Angela to traverse all that outside ground once she opens the door and gets through it (maniacal tilted compositions besides), which is a trope of these kinds of movies.

But Kimi is playful and daring and keeps its feet playfully and yet seriously in the genre, and would probably make for a good painting with Soderergh's own Unsane, also about a woman under dire straits fighting her own inner conflict while powers far greater than her pull the strings. It's a minor idiosyncratic gem by a director and writer who make it seem so easy when it's definitely not.

But this film is not for people who want a flashy suspenseful ride, its more psychological than that, about sometimes having to forgo our own discomforts for what we believe is doing the right thing.

I think going into this film with the expectation of it being a thriller is a bit misleading. It is more of a digital crime drama, and in those genres it is very good. Zoe excels at playing introverted characters, and this is no exception.

The direction, choice of colours, lighting, style is very chic and it gives it a very digital almost clinical feel, and sometimes surreal. The music felt a little off for me, the director opting for a more classical crime arrangements. I feel it may have been better off with something more modern.

Successful conspiracy cyber thriller from the eclectic Steven Soderbergh, original despite his cinematographic references, which he updates and resignifies. And unlike much of contemporary cinema, with a plot where the Covid is present.

Review

Angela is a technician who works from her house for a computer corporation called Amygdala. Her job is to fix bugs and improve the user experience of the corporation's virtual assistant called Kimi, similar to Alexa or Siri. To do this, she must listen to the ""dialogues"" between the users and the assistant recorded in streams. When in one of these dialogues she thinks she sees a violent situation, she decides to report it to the company.

Angela lives in a huge loft in Seattle from whose large windows she looks at her neighbors (and is looked at) and suffers from agoraphobia. The first part of the film describes her daily life with economy of resources, of which the Covid pandemic is part. Yes, it is a film in which chinstraps appear (unlike most of a cinema that is obstinate in ignoring Covid) and where the issue of isolation is skillfully integrated into the pathology of the protagonist.

Kimi is a cyber thriller that threatens with some cinematographic references (such as Rear Window or Her) to resignify them, since the protagonist is not the look but the listen, bringing the film closer to Brian de Palma's Blow Out, with the theme of the invasion of privacy in the center of the scene.

When Angela begins the odyssey tending to denounce what she hears, the conspiracy plot announced in the first part is consolidated and Soderbergh gives us absolutely frenetic action sequences. It is truly remarkable what this director can do with the camera and Zoë Kravitz's bodywork when she has to deal with the outside is remarkable; the feeling of oppression and threat is physically transmitted to the viewer. Cliff Martínez's music (which ranges from analog to electronic) is essential to accompany and determine all the climates that the film goes through.",8,1,1

This is a one-woman show and she captures your attention as a frailed, isolated woman plagued with agoraphobia. With notes of ""Rear Window"", the film is a modern exploration of claustrophobia (among other fears) and voyeurism at its taut best. It also borrows inspiration from Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" with themes of surveillance, privacy, and paranoia involving a smart phone device named Kimi, much like an Alexa or Echo device. This little hidden sleek flick now streaming on HBO Max had me on edge, culminated into a most satisfying finale, and is most definitely worth a watch on a lazy evening.",9,1,1

There was multiplex cinema next door to conference center and the film ""Brian and Charles"" was playing there. I had no idea what the film was about but decided to go on impulse. Wow, I couldn't be more delighted with what I experienced. It is a charming film about a relationship between a man and a robot he invented. It is funny and heartwarming with wonderful performances and beautiful cinematography depicting the rugged land and stark beauty of Wales.

627,627,Brian and Charles,6.7,Comedy,24-Jun-22,All The Quintessential Elements Of A Perfect Friendship Film,"The film Brian and Charles has all the quintessential elements of a perfect friendship film. Director Jim Archer makes his feature debut in this quirky British comedy in which an eclectic cast does a spectacular job demonstrating the very real ebbs and flows of true companionship. Despite some significantly low moments in their friendship, including an explosive argument, Brian and Charles remind us that true friendship never dies; it only strengthens through adversity.

Brian and Charles' friendship has an unconventional origin. Brian (David Earl) is an isolated inventor in Wales who specializes in weird inventions. Despite his passion, his interventions often flop. Driven by depression and loneliness, Brian builds a robot using a washing machine and spare parts lying around his home. Charles is clunky yet charming. He is obsessed with cabbage, uses the dictionary to learn English, and loves socializing, dancing, and adventures.

In this film, Brian, played by David Earl, has finally invented the cure for his loneliness. What he doesn't anticipate is that Charles, played by Chris Hayward, is much more of a free spirit than he is. Despite their dance parties, pillow fights, and mutual love for cabbage, Charles deeply desires to see the world, while Charles is content with a quaint and straightforward life in Wales. One of my favorite parts of the film was watching Charles dance in a hula skirt and beg to go to Honolulu. Their competing wishes ultimately become the source of tension in their friendship. While the film centers on Brian and Charles, Louise Brealey's performance as Hazel, Brian's love interest, is worth mentioning. Their awkward yet sweet interactions between her and Brian give the film comedic relief.

Brian and Charles reminds us that sometimes ""friend"" is actually another word for family, and sometimes loving someone means letting them go. Brian and Charles' friendship survived heated disagreements, conflicting visions, and even a kidnapping. But, ultimately, they proved that the love would never fade no matter the distance between them.

I give Brian and Charles 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 9 to18, plus adults. Brian and Charles releases in theaters June 17, 2022.

628,628,Brian and Charles,6.7,Comedy,22-Jun-22,"A charming, amusing and touching surprise","BRIAN AND CHARLES is a gentle and deeply silly movie that is surprisingly touching when it's all said and done. Coming in at a brisk 79 minutes, the movie-makers knew they had a slight story to tell, and haven't padded it. Tell your quirky story and get out. Yet, in this brief time, it says some pretty touching things about the need for friendship and connection, the impact of finding it, and also, strangely, reminds us that being a home-body who doesn't want to leave the local valley or a wanderer who wants to see the world are both valid and fulfilling choices, if freely chosen.

Brian is a middle aged Welshman living in a gorgeous but harsh area of Wales. Rolling hills, sheep herds, quaint villages and a stunning river. But Brian lives alone is his ramshackle home and adjacent workshop. Unkempt and shy, Brian occupies his time mostly with his nusto inventions that never work. For example, he crafts a flying machine made with a bicycle that has a grandfather clock strapped to it so that he can fly over his village and shout out the time to anyone who needs it. It's a failure, of course. But his construction of it shows us how eccentric he is and how much he wants to be of use to his fellow man; the fellow man he struggles to connect with. Other constructs of his are equally unsuccessful, and of dubious need.

One day, finds the head of a mannequin, and decides to build himself a robot. And stunningly (and without any explanation whatsoever), the robot works. This is Charles (or as Charles dubs himself ""Charles Petrescu"", surely the most random name a Welsh robot has ever given himself). A friendship of sorts forms between the two, but it's a bond that grows and evolves in gently surprising ways. And Charles is just the ""social lubricant"" that Brian needs to engage more in the world around him.

Minor dramas ensue, and poor Charles has some unfortunate adventures...but none of it is too taxing. This is not a film to get your heart rate up to much. But it never takes an easy path in telling its story. Charles can be extremely funny at times, but also a frustrating pain in the neck at others. And Brian can be a great ""father figure"" at times, and a churlish brat at others. It all has the air of a forgotten folk tale, yet there's real heart here.

Although devoid of belly laughs (and not trying for any), I found myself smiling throughout almost all the film, chuckling aloud a few times, and as I said, being surprisingly touched by the conclusion of this film.

And I must say that the ""design"" of Charles is remarkable. A mannequin head with hair attached, with a torso made of an old washing machine and wobbly but almost human looking legs, all wrapped in comfortable sweaters and brown tones. He's a sight-gag that never stops being amusing. Yet coupled with the outstanding voice performance of Chris Hayward, Charles Petrescu is a robot for the ages.

635,635,Brian and Charles,6.7,Comedy,19-Jun-22,Brian and Charles -- One Man's Trash is Another Man's Treasure,"If you like ""Lars and the Real Girl"" you'll love Brian and Charles.

Brian and Charles is a mockumentary about socially awkward hoarder and oddball inventory named Brian who builds a companion robot from a pile of junk.

He names his robot Charles who soon takes on a life of its own becoming more adventurous than his safe creator Brian.

Charles informs himself by reading the dictionary and becomes quite curious about the outside world -- the world beyond the borders of Brian's isolated Welsh quarters.

Charles craves adventure, unlike Brian who wants to live a boring and obscure life -- free from heartbreak and danger.

Brian's an endearing creature who collects junk which he uses to alter household appliances that he claims as new innovations -- totally oblivious that these contraptions are made worse.

This is a metaphor for how Brian sees himself and how he presents himself to this phantom documentary crew that's documenting his mundane life. Brian's a disheveled hermit, obtuse and discard, like a pile of junk that nobody wants. That's how Brian sees himself.

So he builds a better Brian from that pile of junk. A robot who's willing to experience life.

This is a heartwarming story about fear, loneliness and the importance of human connection.

I highly recommend this film.",8,1,1
636,636,Brian and Charles,6.7,Comedy,18-Jun-22,Picture if Bill Forsyth adapted an unreleased Asimov story,"Brian and Charles, despite the science fiction vibe that would seem evident from it's premise, is really a wholly gentle semi-fantasy (with a very loose documentary framing that comes and goes as it pleases) about what ups downs come to becoming a parent.

The analogy is up front and obvious, right down to Charles creating child-like drawings of his slightly eccentric creator Brian and his cabbages, and then into his, ahem, ""teenage"" years where he locks himself in his room to mope and listen to loud heavy metal when Brian won't let him outside. It's also about how sometimes you just can't let the bullies of the world push you around anymore and using one's imagination is the only salvation.

That makes it sound potentially heavier than this all is, when in reality Jim Asher in his debut has crafted a light comedy that could be appealing to families (or ones that aren't averse to Welsh accents and dreary rural backdrops), and it's often quite funny, mostly early on as we get to learn who Brian is and how he's just constantly inventing and creating this and that (the town bully's daughters want Brian to make them the same Pine-Cone tote bag he's made, because who wouldn't want one I guess), but also how deadpan Charles is when making his demands to go see this or that or create his Hawaiian costume to go off to Honolulu.

Again, nothing about how this unfolds matters much for the seeming sci-fi trappings, and that's actually fine: I'd prefer if it's going to be about the characters and how they grow and bond with each other for that to be genuine, and Brian and Charles is certainly that. I mentioned the docu-style set up, and why exactly this crew is following this man in this environment is hard to figure, and that plus the filmmakers using it or not using it depending on what the scene entails makes things a bit shaggy and inconsistent stylistically (ie how there are good two-camera set ups often enough to not miss anything, or when things are leading to the climactic showdown between Brian and Eddy). And if you think more deeply about other implications, like what Eddy and his bully family want to do with Charles, it could be questionable.

But if you're just watching for this little idiosyncratic world, it's a sweet story that brings you along that is anchored especially by the appealing performances of David Earl (with those perpetually kind eyes and perfectly but pleasantly shlubby countenance) and Chris Hayward (coming for Anthony Daniels crown for best uptight british android voice), who also wrote the piece. It's the movie equivalent of a nice slice of pie, and sometimes that's all I want.",7,1,1

The cinematography was simple, not much to mess up as it's like filming a crazy hoarder in the middle of nowhere somewhere in Wales. I get it that some people will find this entertaining but to me it fell short. Brian and Charles is definitely not a movie I need to watch again in the future but I've seen worse, way worse.

So very cool that just a guy in a washing machine with the right story and dialog can make a low budget gem like this.

643,643,Brian and Charles,6.7,Comedy,14-Jul-22,"Oddball, quirky, and charming","IN A NUTSHELL: After a particularly harsh winter, Brian goes into a deep depression. Completely isolated and with no one to talk to, Brian does what any sane person would do when faced with such a melancholic situation. He builds a robot.

This charming movie is the directorial debut by Jim Archer. The writers, David Earl and Chris Hayward, also star in the movie.

If you love oddball humor and a spot of British tea, you might enjoy this creative spin on the Frankenstein story. Reviews have been coming in from a terrible 1-star grade to high praise with 10-star reviews. Clearly, this type of cheeky humor isn't for everyone. It's strange and endearing at the same time.

THINGS I LIKED: It's absolutely lovely to spend some time in the beautiful Welsh countryside. I had the great pleasure of going there a few years ago. True Welsh is impossible for most people to understand so, thankfully, we hear British/English with a thick Welsh accent. It's a fun introduction to the bucolic spot on the globe called Wales.

I had never seen David Earl or Chris Hayward in anything before. You can tell they had a blast making this movie together.

In the style of THE OFFICE, Charles talks straight to the viewing audience, assuming a camera is following him around everywhere. That element of breaking the fourth wall plays heavily in Act 1 but then tapers off tremendously in Acts 2 & 3.

At times, the dialogue is clever and witty.

Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end for photos of what happens next after the film ends.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Some American audiences might find it difficult to understand everything that's said because of the thick Welsh accent. This is one of those movies where you'll want to turn on the captions if you're streaming this on your TV.

Many viewers will be bored, waiting for something to ""happen"".

TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some British profanity like ""bloody hell"" Adult bullying is portrayed Some violence

THEMES: Creativity Imagination People on the Spectrum - I'm assuming two of the characters are. Did you interpret it that way?

646,646,Brian and Charles,6.7,Comedy,25-Jun-22,Robot story needs a lot of credulity,"Brian is a rural loner, junk scavenger, hoarder, handyman, tinkerer, and inventor (the results of which are not commercially viable). At one point he builds a robot, which comes alive and sentient, and accepts the name Charles. While Charles read the dictionary and is a font of knowledge, he is emotionally somewhere between a 3-year-old and a teenager. Charles has about the opposite personality to Brian - inquisitive and adventurous, rather than private and secure. I feel that their relationship is more overprotective parent and child, rather than ""friends"". While Charles manages to help Brian get a real girl, things get dangerous when he comes to the attention of the town bully.

This is told (at least in part) as a mockumentary, with a brief interchange with a mockmentary crew member about AI, which Brian seems to be hazy about. That is well and good (and needed) when Brian is alone, but where is the crew when he interacts with more people? Also, Brian turns out to be an inadequate parent, giving Charles commands rather than information and reasoning. So these defects push my score down to a 6.

This is a Welsh film, and so has a different sensibility than a stereotype American film. It is more gentle, and even the violence is rather muted, which could be a draw for some people.",6,0,0

As the robot's intellect & character grows & evolves (like an accelerated child's) so does his relationship with Earl as he learns of love (via Louise Brealey), perilousness (via local bullies Jamie Michie, Nina Sosanya & kids) & dreams.

649,649,Brian and Charles,6.7,Comedy,24-Jul-22,Weird,"Don't misunderstand me, I like weird cinema. I've watched and enjoyed Gaspar Noe, Lars Von Trier and even David Lynch as a more accessible weirdo. But something about the world of Brian and Charles just didn't resonate.

Firstly, the film is written in a very, very heavy handed way. The antagonists are probably the thinnest written, working class tropes you're ever likely to encounter. And actually the humour in this, ahem, comedy punches down in ways that the writers are clearly unaware of. I can laugh, like the rest of us, at mental illness, Tourettes, fart jokes, irreverent humour but for me there has to be an acknowledgement, an awareness by the comic of what you're doing - as a matter of respect to the recipients of your down-punching. I never got the sense that both writers were respectful of this.

Anyway, I actually thought this was going to be an interesting love story between a social outcast and a hulking male robot and, I wouldn't mind seeing that story. In the same week that a bloke was sacked from Google for saying in the press that he was working on an AI that he believed had become sentient, there is a rich arena of ideas to be explored. This is what probably is most disappointing about Brian and Charles: it doesn't know what film it wants to be. The label says COMEDY but it's just not funny enough and it's not intelligent enough to explore the likelihood of love/pathos emerging between humans and robots.",4,-1,-1
650,650,The Witch: Part 2 - The Other One,6.2,Action Mystery Thriller,19-Jul-22,Nowhere near as good as the first movie,"That's really all I have to say. I could sit here and enumerate a dozen, if not more, reasons why this movie profoundly lacks the magic of the first one, but I find myself a little exhausted after being disappointed by it. I still rate it a 6/10. It was a good watch. Lots of over the top gore and anime style action. However, the movie seems keen on cramming in all these new characters with powers, and in the end it sort of invalidates the original girl's powers as a whole. If everyone is special, then no one is special.

Too many little stories are crammed into the runtime of this movie, and I think that's where it inevitably fell short. The acting, cinematography, etc, is all absolutely stunning from a visual standpoint. I think it was really just the overall script that held it back from capturing that same lightening in a bottle as the first movie.

I kept asking myself ""who are these people?"" ""Wait, why are these two people fighting?"" ""Why isn't she already butchering everyone?""

What I really and truly hope for, is that now that this lore and origin story is out of the way, that the third movie will hit with a massive bang, and really justify the existence of the second movie.

Character development is fine but it should not take up two thirds of what is essentially an action film. Regrettably, that's exactly what you get.

Worse still, there are so many side characters and sub plots, it quickly becomes a confusing mess. You really have little idea what is going on, why and who half these largely redundant, side characters are.

This films only saving grace is reasonable acting. That said, so much else simply doesn't work, that means little in the scheme of things.

All in all, an awful sequel to a vastly superior original film. Its weighed down by a lack of pace, bland, uninspired storytelling and an over emphasis on side plots and characters that add little to nothing, to the tale.

However, the whole plot ofo the film felt simple. For two hours, you were basically watching two groups of supernatural humans chase one god-like girl that took all of them down within 15 minutes. I wish they added more depth into the story, focused more on the girl's origin and maybe more on how she became the strongest and most powerful of them all. What happened in the lab?

The story retreads the first film's in the tale of a new test subject who takes refuge at a remote farmhouse before the bad guys show up. At nearly two and a half hours in length, most of this feels like cheesy padding, with about three different sets of villains for no good reason.

663,663,The Witch: Part 2 - The Other One,6.2,Action Mystery Thriller,07-Mar-23,Witch is Not,"Every so often, when a motion picture is unexpectedly well received, writers and directors tend to make the story in the sequel twice as explosive. And sometimes this works and other times it doesn't.

What worked in Witch I was not the expansive action but it was rather how seemingly a simple narrative unfolded as a complex and unusual one. It was about getting to know a traumatized young child who played an innocent introvert, loved by her best friend, and adored by her adoptive family. In the end, it turned out that her shy young teen appearance was a well-thought-out facade, a cunning plan for survival. She carefully searched and selected the family who adopted and adored her. Although, she also loved them back. Characters were slowly built up. The story made sense, we felt her anger, despair, and concerns. Her supernatural abilities were in the background and were not the main story.

However, in Witch II, all of the supernatural abilities are in the foreground like in the DC Universe. There are almost no character built up and there is no story to tell. Most people have superpowers. They bounce like a pinball in the air and it is hard to make out who's hitting who. But then that does not matter because large amounts of characters are introduced to us except with minimal dialog without a background. We don't get to understand why they fight except for small excerpts. And what is told does not make any sense. Some of the beginning scenes are straightforward copies of Milla Jovovich's Resident Evil franchise (where she walks out of the hospital disengaging seemingly relentless tubes).

Lastly, subtitles do not always follow the act. Sometimes it comes to the fore and others to the aft. I find myself rewinding more than a few times.

However, I must say that ""Manyeo 2: Lo Go"" was a swing and a miss, and it didn't reach the predecessor to the ankles. Why? Well, the script and storyline was a rather chaotic and disjointed one, and it was somewhat cluttered as well, making it a bit hard to really know what was going on. The writing in ""Manyeo 2: Lo Go"" felt rushed and half-hearted, making it a less enjoyable movie to watch. And then there was the whole thing of 'wait, wasn't this almost exactly the same as what transpired in the first movie?' going on as well.

Visually then ""Manyeo 2: Lo Go"" was good, no doubt about it. The special effects were good and the action scenes were definitely great to look at. But the special effects could only do so much to lift up the movie that was sinking fast from the rubbish script.

The acting performances in the movie were good, but the character gallery in ""Manyeo 2: Lo Go"" felt somewhat incomplete and superficial. You don't really form any attachments to the characters in this sequel, so it hardly matters what happens with the characters on the screen.

""Manyeo 2: Lo Go"" was a rather disappointing movie experience, and not really a movie that is necessary to watch if you enjoyed the 2018 ""Manyeo"" movie.

We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion. The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a ""real"" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film. Aside from her glamour - which was, even then, hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character, we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar, and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills. It relies to a considerable extent on the viewer's existing knowledge of, and affection for, this flawed lady. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination. It is far, far too long and in a packed cinema, I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often. Watchable, certainly, but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women.",5,-1,0
676,676,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,28-Sep-22,"A disjointed, episodic look at Monroe's miseries! [+42%]","""Blonde"" is sadly reduced to the collective tragedies (and horrors) that the iconic actress went through in her short 36-year-old life. Don't get me wrong, Ana de Armas totally owns the role and gives it her all (God bless her cheekbones!). She also gets worthwhile support from the cinematography, production design, costume, and make-up departments. The biggest letdown is the script that heavily lacks connective tissue between what feels like various disjointed episodes in Monroe's life. Again, each of these episodes are stripped down to repetitive plot-points such as the absentee father, the abortions, the failed marriages, and most importantly, the male gaze.

Writer-director Andrew Dominik perceives Marilyn Monroe and Norma Jeane as two distinct personas, the former being a glowy, on-screen cover-up for the distressed latter. Again, because the film is only interested in showcasing the worst of her life, as viewers, we feel disconnected early on, especially given the film goes on for a butt-numbing 160 minutes. Also, I didn't particularly like the transition between black & white and color bang in the middle of certain scenes. What was the underlying point? The film basically leaves Armas to do most of the heavy lifting since the script only attempts to look at her as an object of desire.

Of course, there are more than a few controversial stretches in the film, and if that's barring a scene with a speaking foetus, then I'm probably dreaming it all up. This isn't what Norma would've wanted to be seen as her ""legacy"", and both entries Netflix has come up with thus far on Marilyn Monroe (yes, I'm looking at you The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes) are lacklustre.",4,-1,-1

There are some ""invented"" moments that are, quite frankly, unforgivable. What kept me glued to the screen was Ana de Armas. A tremendous show of talent and fearlessness. I was wondering what the experience would have been to watch it in a theater with other people? I don't know because in the privacy of my own home I was free to stand up and walk away to pour myself a drink and shout at the screen. The awful Kennedy episode for instance. Why? That episode in particular made me question the intention of the filmmakers. So, yes, I can say now that I've seen it. Loved some it and detested some it.",5,0,0
678,678,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,28-Sep-22,buck up for this one,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those who have studied Marilyn Monroe's personal and professional life, writer-director Andrew Dominik's (first feature film since KILLING THEM SOFTLY, 2012) interpretative adaptation of the 2000 novel by Joyce Carol Oates may send them into the early stages of shock. In fact, regardless of one's level of knowledge of the details of Marilyn's background, shock and bewilderment are likely reactions. It should be made clear for all viewers that it's a fictionalized account of her life, not a true biography. One should also know that this is cinematic artistic mastery to complement an incredibly in-depth and revolutionary performance from Ana de Armas (KNIVES OUT, 2019, NO TIME TO DIE, 2021).

At times, the film is surreal, while at others, downright hallucinatory. It's certainly never boring. However, it's a disturbing beatdown and a grueling watch for a single sitting at close to three hours long. The film begins in 1933 with a young Norma Jeane (Lily Fisher) living in poverty and misery with her single mom Gladys (a terrific Julianne Nicholson). Mom has obvious mental issues and would much prefer Norma Jeane not be around. It's here where the 'Daddy issues' take hold - issues that stick with the girl for the remainder of her life. After being rejected by her father, her mother, and the friendly neighbors, Norma Jeane ends up in an orphanage. A montage takes us through her teenage modeling years, where we see the beginnings of her being taken advantage of and treated as a commodity.

There is an extended sequence involving the threesome of Marilyn and the sons of Hollywood legends Charlie Chaplin and Edward G Robinson (Xavier Samuel, Evan Williams, respectively), and a vicious rape scene with a studio head ""Mr. Z"" (hmmm). Marilyn's first pregnancy leads to an abortion, which is the first of a few tragedies she will experience - and director Dominik finds an entirely new (and bizarre) method of filming these occurrences. The Joe DiMaggio (Bobby Cannavale) and Arthur Miller (Oscar winner Adrien Brody) marriages are noted, yet the men go unnamed, instead referred to as ""former athlete"" and ""playwright"" ... as if somehow that will trick us.

Of course, all of these relationships are right in line with her ""Daddy issues"" ... Marilyn even goes so far as to call these men ""Daddy"", in hopes that one will finally give her the love and acceptance she so craves. One of the more uncomfortable scenes (and that's saying something) involves her tryst with JFK (also unnamed), played by Caspar Phillipson, whose uncanny resemblance to the former President has resulted in his casting for the role in multiple projects. It's likely this White House moment, replete with Marilyn's inner voice, is responsible for the film's NC-17 rating.

Dominik and cinematographer Chase Irvin recreate some of the most memorable film moments from Marilyn's career ... including the subway vent scene from THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH. After capturing that film magic, the sequence seems to drag on with leering onlookers and what proved to be the final straw with DiMaggio. A recurring feature involves Marilyn receiving and reading letters from the father she's never met - including promises of meeting ""soon."" The payoff for this is disappointing for us and for her.

Perhaps the main point of Dominik's movie is the enormous gulf and psychological contrast between Norma Jeane, the eternally-scarred young girl, and Marilyn Monroe, the iconic bombshell she created for public consumption. There is a sadness about her most of the time, even when she flips that switch to become Marilyn - the familiar sultress adored by so many. Toby Huss plays Whitey, a version of real-life Allan Snyder, who was Marilyn's long-time make-up artist and confidant. Her famous diary gets a mention, and we see the price she paid for taking drugs to calm anxiety while dealing with the crushing weight of fame.

Ana de Armas delivers a performance for the ages. Of course, the scrutiny she will face playing one of the most famous women of all-time will be senselessly nitpicky, yet from an artistic standpoint, her work is supreme. Costume Designer Jennifer Johnson somehow manages to nail the different stages, films, and moods (of both the film and its subject). Is this exploiting the woman who made a career out of being exploited? Or is it simply telling a story? Norma Jeane was a fragile creature constantly victimized as she desperately searched for love. Has the filmmaker continued that abuse with this vision? From a moviemaking aspect, it's' a thing of beauty. From a human perspective, it's torturous to watch. If you are in need of a 'feel-good' movie, keep searching. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for the work of a cinematic visionary and one of the best acting performances of the year, settle in.

679,679,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,28-Sep-22,Mixed feelings,Ana de armas gave an inspiring performance and she really acted her heart out. The story and it's execution was a masterpiece at places and the cinematography and aesthetics were on a new level. As I don't know that much about marlyn I don't actually care how they portrayed her. The main accomplishment of the film is that it shows the horrors of Hollywood masterfully and how sometimes famous people or actors lose themselves as a person underneath the limelight and become somewhat of a lost soul. In some respects they failed to make it feel impactful and it seemed disjointed sometimes. But to see ana de armas act her heart out and netflix do something new is truly refreshing. And it's such a long film but surprisingly didn't seem dragged.,7,0,1
680,680,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,30-Sep-22,Why Tell Fictional Stories About a Real Person?,"Marilyn Monroe was a great artist and this movie could've been a great opportunity to teach younger audiences about who she was. But for some reason, they decide to tell a fictional story. She has the same name, plays in the same movies, and sings the same songs, but many events are made up. It's so misleading when movies do this. It's not a movie about Marilyn Monroe, it's a movie about a mentally ill actress. Monroe was more than a mentally ill sex symbol. She was intelligent and a great artist - which doesn't come across in this movie.

Ana de Armas is okay in the movie. She looks and sounds like Monroe, but she is naked for an uncomfortable amount of time in the movie. It's not just the fact that she's naked, but she's naked for no apparent reason. If her being naked adds nothing to the story you might as well let her put some clothes on.",2,-1,-1
681,681,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,29-Sep-22,Bold and exceptionally well-made,"Blonde was already one of the most controversial and hotly debated films of the year before it hit Netflix, and therefore became available to the public at large. That's happened within the last day or two, and I expect that will blow up the discussion and discourse around it even more. It's probably going to be what most film news sites or discussion groups focus on for the next week or two, and maybe longer if it ends up earning some nominations for the upcoming awards season.

I don't want to talk about the controversy too much, but it's important to address it briefly. Truthfully, I don't understand most of it. This film is shocking in parts, yes, but not as bad as a lot of the early discussions surrounding it made it sound. Almost none of the scenes that involve sex or nudity are presented in a titillating way, and they're all over quite quickly. There's very little about it that's supposed to be erotic, and I think that's evident by how the camera tends to lock onto Norma Jean's face, to emphasize the pain, discomfort, and trauma she feels during those scenes.

So is it exploiting that pain, discomfort, and trauma? That seems to be the other big talking point. I didn't think so. I think the film was sympathetic to her, and aimed to showcase how misogynistic the film industry was at the time Norma Jean/Marilyn Monroe was active within it. It's arguably not much better nowadays, but whether these exact things happened to her or not feels somewhat beside the point. The fact is, things similar to this did almost certainly happen to Monroe and other young actresses. That idea is horrifying, and I think the film successfully painted it as horrifying.

Ana de Armas is fantastic in the lead role. She'll probably get some nominations come awards season. The rest of the cast are solid, the film is visually stunning from start to finish, and I loved the music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (at least one track was a repurposed instrumental from Ghosteen, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' last album, but it fit so well I didn't mind).

For complaints about the filmmaking itself? The nearly three-hour runtime might be a little indulgent, but for the most part it earns it. There are also some occasionally strange and baffling creative decisions, but for every one that doesn't work, there's at least several strange creative decisions that do.

I thought Blonde was pretty great overall. I understand to a limited extent why it's become controversial, but can't wrap my head around the magnitude of that controversy. Still, if it's got people angry, I don't plan to wade into any discourse or make discussions more heated. I've defended it here and said my piece. I think it's very good.",8,1,1

A lot of nude shots, Marilyn calling her husbands ""Daddy"" the babies she couldn't have, her intelligence got short shrift and her drug taking a huge focus, fed by her handlers.

John F. Kennedy, the womanizer, is depicted in a particularly revolting scene.

684,684,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,29-Sep-22,Two Personalities in one Body,"I really liked it a lot. Andrew Dominik showed us the dark side of Marilyn Monroe simply becuase nobody dared to do this before and there was (for sure) a dark side of her. I liked how he portrayed Monroe as two differnt characters that try to allign with each other. Ana de Armas perfeclty portrayed this rollercoaster of emotions. Showed us a pitch perfect - by the standards - Marilyn and her alter ego Norma Jean perfectly in ambiance. She truly gave one of the best performances I have seen all year and hopefully will get the deserved attnetion coming awards season for it.

I do no understand all the scandal buzz around that film as there was not really anything scandalous about it execpt that it showed us the probably most famous Hollywood icon in a completely different light.

The only thing you can blame Andrew Dominik for is that he still did not let us as close to Marilyn as I hope it would be. Yes he gave us a different version of that known personaity however we never felt close to her. But i guess this might have been intentionally. Because can you be close to such an icon and legend - to the symbol of Hollywood?

The length of the film did not bother me at all - in fact I was afraid a bioic that long that just focuses on one person could have lenghts. Not this one. I was captued to the screen the whole time, thanks to the perfect performances by Ana de Armas but also the creative technical decisions that were chosen.

It is a stream of consciousness that plays out more like a dream than a movie. It is visually stunning. The look and the details of this movie are stunning and breathtaking at parts. Ana de Armas is so unmistakeable as Marilyn Monroe that it is eerie. The effects working her into the actual Monroe films are seamless. The supporting case of actors are wonderful. This is a heavy dark movie in so many ways. It is a biography, but it is also the struggle of Norma Jean to distinguish herself from Marilyn Monroe, the character. It is also and ode to love, and to finding peace and identity through love. This movie is unique and brilliant, but it is not for someone looking for an easily digestible, chronological telling of the life of Marilyn Monroe.

There is also very sexual (sexual assault) scenes and they are so uncomfortable and unnecessary and felt a little disrespectful to show especially for that long! A lot of unnecessary nudity to be honest and abortion scenes which were too long and showed way too much and this happened 2/3 times it was horrific.

Longer than your typical movie, it's only through the compelling and gripping performance of Ana de Armas that it gets away with that longevity, although the subject matter of this grim, fictionalised telling generally captures most people's attention, but I'm not sure the exposure she gets throughout really adds to the value.",7,-1,1

Lugubriously directed by Andrew Dominik, this overlong 2022 film is not a straight-up biopic but an episodic cautionary tale of pre-Harvey Weinstein abuse and power politics taken from a startling first-person perspective. Based on Joyce Carol Oates' 2001 novel, the story is not only tragic but painful to watch with trauma erupting in almost every scene.

691,691,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,01-Oct-22,Marilyn deserved better!,"Blonde review :

A supposed biopic on the Hollywood diva Marilyn Monroe; Blonde has a scene where a group of snobbish oldies ask a young Monroe if her blonde hair is real? To which he hesitantly replies No. The moment is given a surreal touch depicting the insecurities of a star who had faced a troubled childhood and was a lonely loser beneath all that gloss and glamour.

The film's biggest positive is of course Ana De Armas who literally gets in to the skin of the titular character. Her transformation from the diffident Norma Jeane to the movie star Marilyn is truly incredible and full marks to her for getting it bang on...brilliant indeed!

Director Andrew Dominik doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of Monroe's life whether it was her blatant exploitation by the filmmakers of that era or her illicit relationship with the President of United States. It's all there and in all its gory details!! Marilyn's ""threesome"" relationship is also explored uninhibitantly.

On the flipside, the pacing is super slow and some scenes just don't make any sense. Like Norma hallucinating an abortion. Also, Monroe's (in)famous skirt blowing moment in The Seven Year Itch (1955) is filmed in multiple angles here with her undergarments on full display reeking of cheap titillation. Ooff!

With all its plus and cons, Blonde aint too bad for a Netflix watch. It could've been a far better movie though.

693,693,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,30-Jan-23,Was Expecting Worse,"After all of the terrible Internet reviews, I was expecting much worse from ""Blonde."" While I agree that it's not a great, or maybe even very good, movie, it's not terrible, and I'll admit that things about it got under my skin and stayed there, which is always the sign of at least effective filmmaking.

I'm sick to death of biopics, and I don't have much interest in Marilyn Monroe. I don't care for her style of acting, and I'm too young to have been witness to her cultural impact at the time she was living. So from the start I'm not the ideal audience for this movie. And I don't know that I fully understand the point of it. I didn't know going in that it was speculative fiction based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel, so I spent much of the running time wondering how accurate it was. It's a 3 hour marathon of nothing but terrible things happening to Monroe, and it all just starts to feel like exploitative misery porn without any point other than that the Hollywood industry treats people, especially women, badly, as if we didn't already know that. There seems to be some effort to show us that Monroe was more than just a dumb blonde, but a feeble effort at best. We don't really ever get to know her or understand her inner life, so she mostly remains an object for the film to abuse. It really just made me feel bad, and I'm tired of seeing movies this year that seem to exist for the sole purpose of making their audiences feel bad. There's been a lot of them.

Ana de Armas sure gives herself to the role, but I started to feel almost embarrassed by all the things the movie made her do, and did to her. After a while it felt like I was walking in on her in the middle of a bowel movement. As I write this, de Armas was just nominated for an Oscar for her performance. I don't begrudge her the nomination, because A for effort I guess, though hers wasn't one of my particular favorite performances of the year. And she can't lose her accent for anything.

But like I said upfront, the movie did manage to make me feel something, even if that something was mostly bad, which is more than a lot of films do.

As for the movie itself.... overhyped trash. This is based on a fictional book and not her true story. It's sad that she can't even get a legit story but instead gets a fake version. All that aside the movie is almost 3 hours long. And its very slow moving. There are some disturbing scenes of course, but nothing really shocking compared to other movies.

You still get the feeling she was abused by everyone of course. But that's about it. Again, since its not her actual story, it feels like your watching some tabloid version of her life.

I was surprised however in my research to find a 2001 film of the same name... Even though, this screenplay is based off a book, I haven't read it, it it's not a true to fact biography by all reports.

Having said that, this was a well constructed film, aesthetically pleasing, well acted and scripted. You get a combination of both colour and black and white sequences, and a 4:3 aspect ratio. It was slow at times but interesting throughout the 2+hour run time. It's always interesting to see the depiction of the childhood years in these types of films as one can't help compare this to your own. Much like in 'Walk the line' or 'Ray' both excellent biopics. It does tackle some very sad and emotional topics, and some scenes could be hard to watch for some.

This was also Ana's time to shine as she has been knocking on the door of this type of role for many years now.

696,696,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,28-Sep-22,A Parade of Misery,"There's a moment in the opening wildfire scene where Norma Jean's mother expels a sigh that's equal parts anger and exasperation. Who knew that sigh would become my mantra for the rest of this travesty's runtime? ""Blonde"" is a cinematic snuff film: sadistic and exploitative in how it revels in Marilyn Monroe's pain. The way director Andrew Dominik indulges in her misery is nauseating.

Jumping from one traumatic fever dream to the next, this joyless film reduces a cultural icon into a punching bag for the parade of leeches, con-men, charlatans, abusers, and vultures in her life, culminating with ""Blonde's"" director himself. Everyone's queued up to extract their pound of flesh from Marilyn Monroe's legacy in this sick sideshow, both in-camera and behind it.

I've never hate-Googled a DP until now, but holy cow: Chayse Irvin's cinematography is self-indulgent, pompous trend-chasing with zero rhyme or reason. It's three hours of ""herp derp I bet this will look dope.""

Arbitrary transitions from color to black-and-white; aspect ratio swaps for no cohesive or thematic reason; and ""trendy"" camera set-ups (I audibly scoffed at the random chest GoPro angle for Bobby Cannavale in one scene) are but a small taste of the incoherent parlor tricks thrown your way over the course of Blonde's nearly three hours.

As if there aren't enough sins to go around, the sloppy, unbalanced sound design comes in as if to say, ""hold my beer."" There's jarring jumps in volume when Norma Jean's mom screams at her, or when certain sound effects or score elements come in and out. It almost feels like they thought the project was a horror movie that needed jump scares baked in. We must also reserve a special lashing for whoever thought FETUS VOICEOVER would be a worthwhile element to add to this turd-pile of a movie.

I love Ana de Armas' work but whoever signed off on her American accent needs to be drawn and quartered. It vacillates between, ""okay fine"" to ""big yikes."" Every time Ana utters ""Daddy"" was NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD.

The choice to luxuriate in Marilyn Monroe's misery as opposed to condemning the parties who precipitated it is telling. There is a brief moment halfway through where you think Marilyn has finally realized her worth and is ready to speak up for herself as deserving of respect as the freaking reason people come to see her movies, but it putters out as a blip in the grand scheme of the tragedy porn this film prefers to live in.

My biggest regret is viewing this film as part of an in-theater early screening. If I had been watching on Netflix, I could have just ended my misery without much fuss.",2,-1,-1
697,697,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,09-Sep-22,Ana de Armas Stuns in Daring Biopic,"De Armas was incredible in the role, there's absolutely no denying that fact. But neither the direction nor the script actually served her performance. It was an impression of Monroe, which in and of itself was the real Norma Jean Baker's impression of what she thought a bombshell movie star was. Paired with the film's incredible costuming, make-up, and de Armas' - let's be real, nearly identical face, de Armas' dazzling screen presence is inarguable. But with a disjointed directorial eye and a messy script, de Armas is simply doing the best she can within the chaotic world of Monroe's life, but also the chaotic world the film itself forces her to be a part of.",7,0,1
698,698,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,30-Dec-22,REVOLTING!,"Never again should Andrew Dominik be allowed to pervert anyone else's screen with the garbage he tries to sell as art. To say that this film is exploitative is like saying McDonalds is a little hamburger joint. ""Exploitative"""" doesn't even begin to cover it.

Seriously, even sixty years after her death Marilyn Monroe cannot seem to escape the perversion that some people felt (and obviously still feel) was their god-given right to impose on her, or apparently, the cruelty of some within the entertainment industry.

More so, horribly so, Ana de Armas was not only also complicit in exploiting Monroe and her life, but in allowing herself to be debased and defiled as well. This ""film"", although it pains me to even call it that, is nothing more than an overacted, overly-long, drawn out, prepubescent torture fantasy with which Dominik could get his rocks off, and which de Armas thought would solidify her as an industry icon.

If all you are interested in seeing is de Armas or her numerous topless scenes, may I suggest Deep Water? She is just as adorable, seductive and unclothed in that. Plus, even with its low critical acclaim, scores and ratings, it will save you from the assault that is Blonde.",1,-1,-1
699,699,Blonde,5.5,Biography Drama Romance,01-Oct-22,Most will miss the point here.,"As I've seen others review this simply based on being offended by the whole thing, thinking this is just a fictitious telling of the tragedies of Marilyn Monroe or thinking it's exploitative and disgusting and disturbing. This, I believe is part of the point painted in this film. It's not meant to paint a glamorous or nice telling of her story because her story was not a Disney fairytale. Whether these things happened to her or not on the other hand, I don't believe anyone can truly know for certain what happened exactly and what didn't. That being said, all these things in this film have without a doubt happened to other beautiful rising stars throughout the years Hollywood has been a thing. I dare anyone to prove otherwise. I don't think everything that happened on screen didn't happen to Marilyn though. There is a very sad unfortunate possibility that most, if not more terrible things like what happens to her in this did in fact happen to her. I'm certain that there were more happy times that aren't highlighted throughout this piece but that wasn't the point here. This was meant to take a look into the dark side of Hollywood. If what you're looking for is a Disney fairtale, this is not the movie for you. Otherwise, I have not been moved to tears or effected as much emotionally by any other movie this year or most years as of late. Ana De Armas deserves best female actor of the year for this. The film itself deserves all the awards it's qualified for. I loved how it was all told in a David Lynch esq. Type of way. Highly recommended to anyone that is a fan of well made films giving a true glance into the evils of Hollywood and it's not sugar coated.",10,1,1

The topics of conversation at points insinuating very adult things. So it made for an odd mash up, a fairy tale for adults. It was nice to see a high ranking religious official that was truly a good man and not the villain for once. That would have been very clique, and typical of most movies set in this time. Everyone loves to vilify religion, yes I know historically there were, and still are, horrendous acts done in the name of religion but they are few compared to the many that are not. It was just nice to see the good side for once. The overall story was fairly simple, not an action packed adventure. I think a lot of people were bored because they were expecting a swashbuckler or a ""man in the iron mask"" level of action and depth, leading them to be disappointed. I went into this not having much of an idea what it was, I hadn't seen any type of trailer, or heard anything about it. All I knew was what the info attached said, which wasn't much.

705,705,The King's Daughter,5.1,Action Adventure Family,22-Jan-22,The King's Glory Falls To Rushed Plots And Lack of Adventure,"LIKES:

The Pace: There is not much to say on this one outside of it is a good pace to be engaging and surprisingly deep in all the characters they put on the screen. The King's Daughter does not gallivant around with long winded speeches, lengthy openings, or even an establishment of kingdoms other fantasy films try to do. It just dives into the stakes, lays them out for what needs to be done, and then starts moving the pieces to the end. Fun, simplistic, and enjoyable, the movie does still give enough time for the audience to get some character depth to at least some of the players in the tale.

The Music: Another movie to fill our ears with a mixture of genres and types, The King's Daughter is one part orchestral piece and one part modern day alternative. The symphony pieces particularly are my favorite as thy really fit into the world being established by the visual elements. Meanwhile, the modern day alternative holds a place for just mixing some of the classical up, while also acting as an emotional stamp to the scene at hand. It's again nothing that is mind blowing, but it fits the bills well for the grand scheme of things.

The Setting: A good fairytale is all about getting the world created for me, and the King's Daughter's budget achieved this goal for me. Though again not the most astounding build and display of movie big budget, the palace of Versailles is spectacular to play host to the story. It's large hallways, the foreboding chambers, even the gardens themselves all feel like an interconnected palace that holds both good and evil amidst its manicured grounds. As for the chambers to which the mermaid is held, again something that would be fun to have as sort of a pool playground, and meets the functionality and purpose that a palace might hold such chambers in. Regardless, the setting really brings the fantasy element to life, and kudos for the attention to details they pulled to get this movie feeling like the hybrid of history and fiction.

The Costumes: Beautiful to say the least, The King's Daughter serves as a fashion display of the courts from long ago, but of course having the modern day fabrics to recreate them. This movie manages to bring the beauty of main characters out in a gorgeous light, filling us with a wardrobe of variety that you could use for your next Halloween soiree. It again fits the high society life, but still has the class status you would expect from the way things operated back in those times. Even more so, the movie also manages to make a farce of the extravagant makeup that was used as well, wielding a sword that cut through the ""expectations"" and slashing to the core of what that all meant. It's a clever use of costumes, if a bit shallow and simplistic, but just again getting the costumes to look as nice as they did is a nod to the hard work that they did for crafting such fine elements.

The Acting: Hard to pick, but most likely my favorite, the cast of The King's Daughter did a lot of good for the material they were handed. Pierce Brosnan is very elegant and seems to have seated himself on the throne of kingly titles. It's about the same cut he has done in the past few pieces, but I found it a little more grounded and fitting in the complexity of King Louis. Never going too far into overacting, the role has a lot more interaction and credibility than I expected of it, and he pulled it off well. Our lovely mermaid, was not too bad herself, though for high casting call she really did not have the most speaking or even integration compared to the others. Motion capture wise she gets my nod for helping make the mermaid come to life in terms of motion and facial expressions, but that's about it. As for our leads, they are the victors for leading the scenes and really helping establish the dynamic that most will come to see this film for. The male lead is handsome in many physical attributes, but the vulnerability and stalwart bravado are balanced well and make a great male lead that just feels human and is fun. Meanwhile, the lovely leading lady accomplishes much in the film given again the material she had to follow. As the lead of Marie, she held elegance in her mannerisms, and the strength of the girl power movement that is a trend. However, the character is not perfect, and the in your face moments are minimal as she just comes as character struggling to fit into a new world. Her execution is almost flawless, her physical acting quite good in the action and dance scenes, while her delivery is just fantastic in her means to convey her feelings. It was a great performance for a great character, very fitting for the fairytale theme they were going for.

DISLIKES:

Shallow Development: Because it is going for that simple tale approach, the many characters in the movie are rather flat in terms of the depth they could have. There is potential that is met at parts of the movie, but the connective whole of all the players in this game of altered history don't quite feel complete. This is especially true for the mermaid, who has a story, but it's nothing impressive and more a tool and alternate twist approach that is only okay for me. Throw in the darker characters who hold much in the stake of the political affairs, and you again find only half-baked characters who do little to fully mix things up in this tale. More time and more focus could have helped, but in a movie like this that balance could be hard to achieve.

The Action: I know, it's not supposed to be a Marvel movie, but there were plenty of points and use of props that could have given us a little more impasse and challenge to completing the tale. Sadly, the King's Daughter failed to give us a challenge or an exciting conclusion that would leave us remembering the scenes decades later. I again found it fitting, but it seemed a bit too easy int eh grand scheme of things.

A Bit Heavy Handed On The Religious Gestures Given the religion importance of the times, the movie did well with the dialogue for expressing the thoughts and dependence on religion for sovereignty they held. However, sometimes the jokes and the blatant use of the name of God was a little too over the head insulting, and the running jokes got stale. It's a small thing for me, but there was room for better dialogue and a little too much down the line of God.

The Animation of the Mermaid: While it is true that they did better than I could dream of, I can say that The King's Daughter made an interesting choice for bringing the mythological creature to life. We've seen plenty of movies make the half fish/half human characters look real, but this particular one made a CGI digital model that looked a bit off from the actress they casted. It moved beautifully, but there was a lot of things that could have been better with some more time, budget and animation.

The Story: It's sweet, it's motivating, and it's compelling to see these worlds melt together. However, the story is very odd as well and required more time and fleshing out to really maximize it. The two worlds do agree to an extent, but logical gaps, geography limitations, and again a lack of obstacles and stakes blunted the full magic this story could have. When you tie in the religious work ins, minimize the story of the fantasy world to the bare bones and not really incorporate the characters to a stronger extent... the movie's already stretching story is more limited. And of course plenty of plot holes to ignore to make it work.

The VERDICT:

The King's Daughter accomplishes some goals that I did not expect it to accomplish from the trailers. It's a fun pace, with a world that delivers the promise of history and fantasy meeting together, helping immerse you into the world and enjoy the historical culture. With great costumes to fully perform in and look great in, while also having music to help bring the atmosphere up at this time. And the acting is pretty good with the material they were given in this adaptation. However, the movie's budget and attention are noticeable with much of the plot, story, and animation taking a hit and not reaching the full potential I think they wanted. It's certainly not the worst project to come out of the woodwork, but the movie certainly is one that feels appropriate for a streaming service to maximize its potential. From this, my scores are:

Action/Adventure/Family: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0.",6,0,0
706,706,The King's Daughter,5.1,Action Adventure Family,15-Sep-22,Beautiful,"Aside from the modern dresses and pop music it was a good movie. The story anti-climactic and honestly the villain was a complete let down. That was the most wasted talent of a good actor. It felt like the writers forgot all about him them remembered and wrote up a quick high school level ending. The visuals were great with beautifully made CGI. No corny CGI either! The acting was alright for most but the scenes with Pierce Brosnan and Kaya Scodelario were great! William Hurt and Benjamin Walker are the best supporting cast you could ask for!

Overall visually good, acting good but with obvious plot. BUT STOP PUTTING POP SONGS IN NON-MODERN MOVIES! I can't even appreciate them because it just sounds so out of place!

707,707,The King's Daughter,5.1,Action Adventure Family,18-Feb-22,Worth seeing just for Pierce Brosnan as the king of France,"Just look at that cast: Pierce Brosnan, magnificent as an all powerful yet decadent king, William Hurt, great as always as the king's cardinal, Kaya Scodelario, beautiful as ever, Pablo Schreiber as the villain, Rachel Griffiths in a tiny role, even Fan Bingbing as... the non talking CGI creature?! And it's a fairy tale about Louis XIV's France, shot at Versailles, featuring a mermaid! How can you get this wrong?

And wrong they got it. A complete mess where the only redeeming quality is the acting and interaction of Brosnan and Hurt. It's not unwatchable, but a clear failure. And I get it, really. It's not easy to basically do a Disney film (mermaid, pirates, princesses, pompous figures in fancy clothes) in 2015, especially on a budget and with your parent company delaying the release for seven years. But they could have tried harder, made it a two parter, given the characters time to grow and for the viewers to get attached to them. Instead it feels like a bed time story read by a tired parent who just wants to go to sleep.",6,0,0
708,708,The King's Daughter,5.1,Action Adventure Family,28-May-22,8 years sitting on a shelf gives us an absolute mess.,"Set in France during the rule of King Louis XIV (Pierce Brosnan), The King, having grown fearful of his own mortality enlists a ship of fisherman lead by captain Yves De La Croix (Benjamin Walker) to find a mermaid (Fan Bingbing) so a ceremony can be performed during an eclipse where The King will consumer her life force and gain immortality. Meanwhile at a convent, free spirited orphan, Mari-Josephe (Kaya Scodelario), has been summoned to Versailles by the king's Father Confessor, Pere La Chaise (William Hurt), at the king's request to be the court composer unaware she's the king's daughter. As Marie Joseph adjusts to the strange and unfamiliar world of Versailles, she finds herself called by the mermaid and befriends her.

The King's Daughter is a very loose adaptation of the 1997 novel The Moon and the Sun, written by Vonda N. McIntyre, better known for her contributions to Star Wars and Star Trek in novel form with aspects such as the given names of Sulu and Uhura rendered canon. The movie had a long development cycle beginning in 1999 with The Jim Henson Company and eventually moving to Walt Disney Pictures where it lingered in development hell. The project was revived I 2013 when Sean McNamara joined the project as director and filming finally beginning in 2014. While initially set for an August 2014 release by Paramount Pictures, three weeks prior to the release Paramount pulled the film from the release schedule without explanation with only vague stories of ""additional visual effects work"" released through industry trades. The film sat on a shelf for 8 years in limbo with McNamara having released six movies in the interim since filming it. After being retitled The King's Daughter, the movie was acquired by smaller distributor Gravitas Ventures who re-edited the film with some opening and closing narration by Julie Andrews. When the movie was released in the January dumping ground of 2022, reviews were not kind and the film only gathered about $1.8 million against its $40 million budget. The King's Daughter has all the telltale signs of a troubled production that's been attempted to be salvaged by being reversed engineered into a Disney-esque fairy tale, but whatever vision originally intended has been clouded by years of post-production hell and misguided salvage.

From the beginning where our film opens with a CGI rendered book opening as read by Julie Andrews as if we're being told a fairy tale, it becomes painfully clear that this narration and this book was not the original intent. After a ""blink and you'll miss it"" text dump expositing about Louis the XIV and his quest to find the mermaid, Miss Andrews has the thankless job of repeating the same information over again as we go through a poorly rendered CGI book with pictures that are just stills from the movie run through a filter to make them resemble painting (honestly it looks like it's not that far above most gimmick filters on your average smartphone). The opening act is just a mess with the story jumping between The Convent, Versaille, and the expedition to find the mermaid lead by Yves De La Croix and it's both very choppy and rapidly paced so the audience is being suffocated with a lot of exposition about the mermaid, the state of France's and King Louis's power and standing, or various other aspects of the plot that are just rushed through and not given the buildup they should be given especially in a story where you trying to merge real life people with fantasy elements.

The movie fares maybe the tiniest bit better in the acting department, but even then I'm not sure I'd classify any performance as ""good"". William Hurt gives regrettably his final on screen performance before his death in 2022 (albeit filmed in 2014) and for what it's worth Hurt does do a decent job of conveying Pere La Chaise as a man torn between his devotion to God and loyalty to his king with Hurt's more subdued delivery fitting well with a character who's supposed to be a man of faith. Pierce Brosnan is entertaining as King Louis the XIV, even if he does flirt with going over the top, and the scenes between Brosnan and Hurt do seem like they're trying to bring something to this movie. Kaya Scodelario plays our main protagonist as Marie-Josephe and while Scodelario has had a successful career since this movie with her part in the Maze Runner trilogy, Crawl, and the Ted Bundy film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, Scodelario is given nothing to work with as she is portrayed in a very clunky fashion that feels like a crude facsimile of a Disney princess archetype. Benjamin Walker also plays Yves as the love interest and the chemistry between the two of them just doesn't come through on camera. Fan Bingbing gets massively shorts rifted here as the mermaid really doesn't have a character down to the fact she can't talk and serves as a glorified macguffin who often doesn't share the screen with live action actors with the mermaid effects falling into the uncanny valley. The movie tries to file down some of its rougher edges from whatever the earlier version of this film was to try and make it similar to one of those Disney live-action remakes, but when you have scenes of King Louis confessing his sexual indiscretions or dry sequences discussing the nature God versus science (with Science represented with a cartoonishly evil strawman), it doesn't seem like the type of movie that's made for a family audience because despite it's attempts to frame this story as a fairy tale, it just isn't and was clearly never intended to be presented this way.

The King's Daughter is just a mess. While there's clear indication the actors are trying, their work is faced with a Sisyphean challenge against confused editing and a story lacking in clarity as to how and why certain things came into being. The movie just doesn't work on any level, but especially not as the family centered fairy tale it's been reversed engineered into.",4,-1,-1
709,709,The King's Daughter,5.1,Action Adventure Family,21-Feb-22,"A Swashbuckling Adventure With A Royal Heroine, A Mystical Creature And A Fairytale Setting","If you're looking for a swashbuckling adventure with a royal heroine and a mystical creature in a fairytale setting then The King's Daughter is for you! This movie showcases the beauty and majesty of Versailles with breathtaking cinematography that is truly the stuff of dreams.

The King's Daughter is based on the book The Moon and the Sun by Vonda N. McIntyre-a historical fantasy novel taking place during the reign of King Louis XIV of France (Pierce Brosnan). King Louis, known as The Sun King, is the most powerful monarch of that time and obsessed with his own mortality and rule. While seeking the key to immortality, he has his estranged daughter, Marie-Josèphe (Kaya Scodelario) brought to court. She was secretly raised in a convent and is unaware of her parentage but has a forthright character, intellect and beauty that draws him to reconsider his world and values.

The performances in this film really add to the haunting majesty of the storyline under the direction of Sean McNamara. I really enjoyed the depth of the relationship between King Louis (Pierce Brosnan) and his spiritual advisor, Père La Chaise (William Hurt). Naturally, my favorite character is our independent and strong heroine Marie-Josèphe (Kaya Scodelario), and she is a great role model in this film. Interestingly, after playing the romantic roles in this movie, Kaya Scodelario and Benjamin Walker (Captain Yves De La Croix) fell in love in real life! Another magical element is the narration by the incomparable Julie Andrews.

In addition to the acting performances, the breathtaking setting of Versailles imbues its own magic as does the visual effects in this film. Music is another key element which supports the story, and I enjoyed the scenes of Marie-Josèphe (Kaya Scodelario) composing and performing as her music weaves its magic on more than one character. Near and dear to my heart are the sumptuous gowns and costumes designed by Lizzy Gardiner as the exquisite detailing adds to the majesty of the characters.

This film has more than one message as it explores the importance of belief and values. The characters learn to stop hoping for the perfect world and to live in the one that they inhabit and try to make it better-an important message for everyone. King Louis XIV learns through the perseverance of his daughter, Marie-Josephe, that only love is immortal

I rate The King's Daughter 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 14, plus adults who will enjoy it as well. The film opens exclusively in theaters on January 21, 2022. Don't miss this magical story as it unfolds! By Selene W., KIDS FIRST!",10,1,1

Brosnan as the king and Hurt as the priest Pere la Chaise are amazing in depicting the majesty of Versailles, and Kaya Scodelario as the estranged king's daughter who grew up in a convent is the ultimate heroine of the whole story.

It's a beautiful, simple story based on a much richer novel. The cinematography is captivating, the blending of modern topknots and long hair unlikely in the time is just an amusing touch reminding us that this isn't supposed to be a documentary about France's history.

As a medieval fantasy fan, I have to say that this movie is bland, the tale is foolish and it's rather funny watching a bunch of french characters talking with brittish accent.

Art design is a trip on real hairstyle and several outfits of the era depicted. Dialogue is dumb and sounds pretty ridiculous and the same can be said of the acting. Soundtrack has a take on modern vibe but not into a positive way. Mermaid FX is so terrible I thought it was a wax doll, lol. Makes me think that it was made targeting an specific audience, which I would guess being female teens.

That said, it's not the movie sucks (it does), but a more mature audience wouldn't stand watching it, like I didn't. It really hurts me watching an actor of such caliber as William Hurt in a dumb production like this one.

But despite the numerous problems, we liked it.

An absorbing yarn for a cold day, and especially suited for girls age 10-15.

Kaya Scoledario is an appealing heroine - beautiful, spunky, intelligent and kind-hearted - and basically the reason the movie works. Also Benjamin Walker, the dashing but sensible sea captain.

BTW the two met on this film and are now married.

And really fun to see Pierce Brosnan and William Hurt.

Also on the plus side: the mermaid looks mythical, not a beach babe; the setscape and locations of Versaille and Australia; the horses.

Yes there are many negatives including horrible contemporary-looking costumes; some editing or narrative errors; and some clunky and anachronistic dialogue.

Really bad decision to do anachronistic costuming!

Also note: the actors who play the selfish young duke, Ben Lloyd-Hughes and scheming doctor Pablo Schreiber, look a lot alike and for a while we thought they were the same person.

The movie could be described as a sort of a combo Masterpiece Theater, CW Channel and old Sci-Fi Channel swashbuckler and period piece.

It didn't underwhelm me as some children's movies do and it didn't overwhelm my daughters as some adult romance movies do. They like a little romance but aren't ready for steam. There are a few kissing scenes, but nothing beyond that. We hadn't seen any advertising for this movie and wouldn't have even known it existed if our local theater hadn't sent an email with a trailer. I think it was a missed opportunity to advertise what is akin to a Princess Bride type fantasy romance. Highly recommend!",10,1,1

Fish!"" when the mermaid showed up, then I realized, he is right. ""Haha, fish"" is the proper way to view this movie. I think because it was made back in 2014 it is totally apolitical today. Like an act of mercy on us. Seeing it I was transported into a hypnotic state. The colors, the sets, the loveably bizarre narcissist BFFs of Pierce Brosnan and William Hurt. It has surreal Tarsem like flourishes, or Cuaron's Little Princess. I am sure there is a story happening somewhere in it. The fact they held it for eight years and it landed in cinema instead of walmart shelves isn't an underdog hero thing but that cinemas are now the walmart shelves. So I am ironically love-watching this. It is like what they would say is a movie in a museum exhibit of movies rather than showing actual classic movies. ""See? Adventure! Fantasy!"" Or that whole ""Princess Bride? We have Princess Bride at home sweetie,"" joke. At its best it is what all those live action Disney movies should have been as it is more airy and dreamy while those films are cut to the bone taking any magic out of them. At its strangest it feels like an entire alternate universe of filmmaking that never happened, with these random and big slow mos and close-ups. But theres a fantasy movie on screen made before the world ended so it has some actual effort in there. I like it as well for that 2014 factor. 2014 is like an old family member I want to show up for because it was a far more innocent time.",10,1,1
725,725,Significant Other,5.7,Drama Mystery Sci-Fi,08-Jan-23,An underwhelming yet decent one-time watch.,"This was a survivalist type sci-fi that was well shot, directed and acted. All casting and performances were on point. The story had a few nice twists, but nothing revolutionary or jaw-dropping. It was well shot with great cinematography and a decent score. Even at a mere 84 min runtime and fairly decent pacing, it still felt longer due to the lack of any constant suspenseful narrative. It did have its moments of intrigue and suspense, but those were too few and far in between the basic camping survivalist theme.

Still, there is a mild edge as we try to understand what is happening. After things are clear on the plot, this turns into a mind game psychological thriller. But it lacks enough tension to be a thriller. Maika Moore and Jake Lacy play off each other well, making their couple in tension highly believable. But, the movie overall boils down to a very small point, and this was underwhelming for me. The movie is less mysterious when watching than what the previews suggest leaving a horror and thriller fan disappointed.",6,-1,0
727,727,Significant Other,5.7,Drama Mystery Sci-Fi,08-Oct-22,Why you shouldn't listen to the negative reviews...,"I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews from critics calling it a ""waste of time"", and audience reviews of 3/5 stars. But remember, people tend to dislike things that are different. And this film is definitely different.

As a Shudder user, I see SO many 1 star reviews of films that I LOVE, saying that they're ""boring"" or ""not horror movies"" (it got so frustrating, I stopped reading them). I've come to the conclusion that the average mainstream-movie watching person only defines a ""horror movie"" as one with a monster/demon/ghost/psycho killer, 90 minutes of interchangeable jump scares (usually of the antagonist appearing BEHIND the characters where only the audience can see), and a high body count.

So brilliant films like Garland's Annihilation, Strickland's In Fabric, Benson & Moorhead's Resolution, or in this case, Olsen & Berk's Significant Other, get passed up because they aren't understood, and therefore raves about, by the casual movie-going, mainstream majority.

I loved this film because it had all of the criteria you'd hope for in the ever-evolving horror genre... tension, suspense, atmosphere, a fitting score, and even a twist you don't see coming. Just because there aren't gory kill scenes every 7-10 minutes by some grotesque creature does NOT disqualify a film from being classified as horror.

So if you truly appreciate horror as an artistic form of film art, something that can make you feel unease and suspense while making you think, then give this a shot and form your own opinion. Fans of horror films like Pontypool, Braid, Hereditary, Come True, or any of the aforementioned films will definitely love and appreciate this one.",9,1,1

The problem this film has is its middle. It feels like it establishes a good tone early. Pretty dark and serious, then all of a sudden things become wacky and it feels like it is going for laughs (I'm torn as to whether this was intentional or it was just coming across this way).

It's pretty hard to dislike a film like this though. It's not preachy and trying to shove a message down your throat. It simply wants to entertain you. I'll give it a 6, but a part of me would like to give it a 7. 6/10.",6,1,0

Are we watching a survival horror or apocalyptic sci fi film? Personally I think they should've stuck with the survival horror throughout because they nailed that part. The sci fi stuff is an interesting idea but man it just completely falls flat and comes across as cheesy and almost comedic at times. The acting is pretty solid except after the guy ""changes roles"". I just couldn't take it serious after that.

While not as creepy and much more overtly explained than that 2013 Scarlett Johansson film, I found definite similarities. To elaborate more on this would be bordering even more on spoiler territory; suffice to say that this film's title is quite the double entendre.

I'm liking Maika Monroe more each time I see her, and she does not disappoint here.

While Significant Other may tip its hand as to what is really going on a bit too early, it's still a pretty entertaining ride throughout its brisk 84 minutes.

Jake Lacy is really rounding out his range after his coming out party in The Office and Maika Monroe continues her great work in horror films. The tone shifts abruptly throughout, but it worked for me for the most part. There are some good twists that surprised me, even with the story being a little predictable where things were heading.

The lead performances were more than acceptable, Maika Monroe is very convincing and fits well into her role. There are many twists that made me re-watch a few scenes over and over again.

It's a low-budget, slow-burner production but definitely worth watching if you lower your expectations. As we all know by now, hiking is always a bad idea and unfortunately the first scene of the movie gives it away. Not completely, but you sort of know something is coming.

735,735,Significant Other,5.7,Drama Mystery Sci-Fi,14-Oct-22,"Not scary, not tense, not funny, not much of anything really","As ""Significant Other"" (2022 release; 84 min) opens, a couple (we later learn they are Harry and Ruth) are on their way to Red Ridge Trail in the Pacific Northwest for a weekend of backpacking. This is Ruth's first time doing this. As they head out, it isn't long before there seems to be something different about this trail... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from frequent collaborators (and co-writers and co-directors) Dan Berk and Robert Olsen (""Villains""). The premise of this movie looks decent enough on paper: a couple goes on a backpacking weekend trip in the remote Northwest Pacific, so what could go wrong? Except that when you actually watch the movie, this premise turns out to be paper-thin and the actual implementation leaves you gasping for air when it goes off the rails and strains all credibility in the movie's second half. The two lead performers, Maika Monroe (as Ruth) and Jake ""The White Lotus"" Lacy (as Harry), try the best they can with the weak material they are given. The outdoor scenery is all but the third character in the film. Beware, though, as quite a few scenes are filmed in the dark (so as to make it look scarier?). In the end, this movie is not scary, not tense, not funny, not credible, and not much of anything really. It just is. The main reason I still give it 5 stars is that this flew by very quickly (if you discount the opening and closing credit, it lasts roughly 1 hr. 15 min.).

736,736,Significant Other,5.7,Drama Mystery Sci-Fi,18-Oct-22,A good thriller with a twist,"First, this is similar to ""Annihilation (2018)"" and ""Prospect (2018)"" in that they're slow-moving sci-fi thrillers. So if you liked those, you'll probably like this.

I went into this knowing absolutely nothing about this movie and came out of it pleasantly surprised. I watch a lot of movies while I work, so more often than not, I'm disappointed in movies (because most are just horrible). This one stands out as one of the better new ones I've watched this year.

This is a slow-paced sci-fi thriller. Emphasize ""slow"", but not really in a bad way. The scenery was beautiful while the plot gives you just enough to nibble on periodically to keep you really interested and then hits you with an ""ah ha"" kind of twist that I didn't see coming. The dialogue and acting is good and I was left questioning practically everything that was happening onscreen until the twist/reveal. I did also enjoy the zoomed-in view on the theme of the movie... taking a look at just a couple of people in a remote area in one part of the country. I imagine many of these kinds of stories happened in this universe that would also be compelling.

The gore and scary stuff was pretty creepy and felt unique and clever. The lead character was somewhat unlikable, but it was her character flaws that played a vital role at the end of the movie, so the way she is was intentional.

Personally, I love the way it ended. The plot gave us plenty reasons it would end the way it did, and yet I somehow I still believed throughout the movie that it wouldn't end that way.... and when it was over, I still felt just as satisfied. Was worth my time.

We then meet Harry and Ruth, a couple, who are coming to the woods for a camping and hiking break. Ruth does not seem keen and appears to be carrying substantial trauma. Harry is quite unsympathetic and pushes Ruth to accompany him even though she seems very nervous and reluctant.

During the few days Ruth does appear distant and anxious, Harry really doesn't help matters. Ruth wanders off to go pee and finds a cave. On further investigation she finds a pool of iridescent blue gloop.

Next thing we see Ruth luring Harry to his death!

The setting and claustrophobic atmosphere is gripping. Miriam steals the show completely. Harry's character is annoying and, to me, their relationship just didn't seem real. Unless it was supposed to be unbalanced and with Harry being a selfish arse. That confused me a bit. However it's still a great new horror/sci-fi.",7,1,1

The scenery was the standout here, lush and provided a great backdrop but boy oh boy was the rest lame.

There's a couple backpacking in the north Pacific woods...she's a bit anxiety-ridden...he's overly smitten with her...but they seem to get along, laughing and teasing and joking; having sex in the tent, etc... The premise seems somewhat realistic and believable which is what makes me keep watching. Yes, I was a bit turned off by the sci-fi alien elements in the very beginning (too ""comic-booky"") but okay...I'm still ""going with it."" (In retrospect, I should have seen those elements as a red flag).

Then the girl in the movie freaks out when the guy proposes to her on a cliff...she has commitment issues....consequently, his feelings are hurt. Later on, when they get back to the campsite...they're not really speaking to each other. (In other words, no sex in the tent).

Then, the somewhat depressed, anxiety-ridden girl has to ""go to the bathroom"" by herself in the woods while the hurt-feelings guy is cooking up a storm over the fire.

Next, the girl is led by some pretty flowers and some bioluminescence goo into a cave. (I guess she forgot about having to go to the bathroom). It's so obvious the girl is being ""lured"" into this cave...obvious to everyone watching, but not to her...then something happens in that cave, but guess what? The audience has no clue what it is! Frustrating.

After that, the girl starts acting all weird...and since I'm getting into spoiler territory here, I'll stop. But...this is when the whole movie SHIFTS into some sort of ""B"" terror crap....totally unbelievable....and to me, a complete turn-off since this is not what I expected!

Yes, I've seen other movies with couples ""lost"" in the woods or on a hike and weird stuff happens....creepy stuff...and usually, I find these movies to be quite compelling. However, THIS movie is definitely NOT one of those movies! This movie just devolves into some weird in-your-face juvenile overly-fake b...-sh...t....and devolves very quickly.

There is no ""slow burn"" anymore....not suspense...no humor, even....no NOTHING. This movie is not written in any sort of sophisticated way. Actually, It seems like it was written by a thirteen year old. It's insulting to the viewing audience. So yea...I turned it off.

Is it okay to write a review when you haven't even viewed the whole movie? Yes...as a WARNING! This movie is NOT what it appears! Maybe you don't care if things are realistic or not. Maybe you don't mind watching something that resembles Creep Show from the 80s (except more attractive to look at and with CG). Then fine...go ahead and watch. But I prefer something at least SOMEWHAT believable. And this is as far from believable as you can get....and not even with any of the cheesy humor of American Horror story!

I don't want to say what that genre is or name other films like it because I would have to mark this review as containing spoilers, but it makes for a film with some great twists.

It tries and somewhat succeeds on being a mediation about the meaning of love and if that sounds a little boring and cerebral, trust me, it isn't. In the second half you will laugh and gasp and probably be very glad you stuck with the story.

They get backstabbing sabotaging teenaged girl relationships very right. All the crazy outfits were so much fun. The soundtrack was full of a great mix of modern music and 90's music. I loved that they included Sarah Michelle Gellar as the headmaster. Sophie Turner has a fun small part. I wasn't familiar with the younger actors, but I thought they all did a great job, no duds in this cast.

Plot twist after plot twist, characters changing constantly, and I'm still not one hundred percent sure what finally happened in the end. This makes Sixteen Candles and a host of other 1980's movies look like high art. Adults playing teenagers is nothing new, but this time it was too much. Some of the scripted references were far too old to be even recognizable by the ""kids"" in the story. And let's talk about those kids for a moment, and how most characters were entirely miscast. The tall, gawky girl from Stranger Things should thank her lucky stars she's getting roles, because she's completely unconvincing as the newest hot girl in the high school. Not happening for a millisecond. And what's her name from Riverdale is certainly hot, but 10 or more years too old to play the role. And who's the short shrimp dude who's supposed to be everyone's dream come true? This guy is supposed to be the most popular boy in school? Does this day school have no jocks? Or perhaps no boys over 5'3""? Casting, people - casting. And it goes without saying that - of course - every bad person in the film is a man, and all of the good people are women (even if they did begin as borderline psychotics). The level of wokeness at first seemed tongue-in-cheek, almost a parody of Netflix's current political push. It wasn't. It was all over the place, as usual. Honestly, this film could have been 60 minutes, and it still would have gone on too long. It didn't know what it wanted to be, so tried to be everything. Hard pass, people - a hard pass.",4,-1,-1

A 28 year old Camila playing a 17-year old, that just doesn't work, I like Maya but honestly if her parents weren't Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke ( one of the best and most famous actor of our time) would she really have a shot? To be in Stranger Things? To get any roles? I think not... Lets be honest: she is not a good actress.. Austin Abrams as the hottest and most popular boy in the school? I think not.... Couldn't remember where I saw him before, then googled and realised he plays the looser kid in Euphoria, seriously? A really small role for Sophie Turner, why did she accept this? I find it hard to believe that after Game of Thrones she isn't being offered better roles, it's just sad... the plot is all over the place, 10 times worse then Riverdale, the girls are really evil then good then evil then good again, the makeover for Eleonor (Maya Hawke) just isn't working... overall, a really bad movie.

It's incredible. As a kid born in '96 the vibe of this film was SO cozy and familiar. It was like rewatching all my favourite teen comedies with the added bonus of hightened and modern aesthetics

I'm also so down for the queer rep and commentary on toxic masculinity and fake feminism. C'mon the 'cis hetero men championing female identifying students' committee. Hysterical.

As someone who loves to illustrate pop culture moments and movie scenes I am dyinnnng to take some from this film. The pastels ugh.

758,758,Do Revenge,6.3,Comedy,18-Sep-22,20 something's playing high school kids...yet again,"It's really getting ridiculous having 20 something's (in this case, at a minimum, a 24yo, 26yo and 28 yo) playing high school students. They don't look like high school students by any stretch of the imagination. But we're stuck with them here and stuck with this script written as if these are real teens. Do writers really believe teenagers talk like this? That most have stopped saying 'like' every other word and express themselves like ultra jaded 40+ adults? Enough with the constant witty repartee and the incredibly intense self-insight. Few real life adults have as much world-weary insight as these teen characters do.

On to the actors- notwithstanding her role in 'Stranger Things', Maya Hawke is not yet a good enough actress (in my opinion) to carry a lead role. Austin Abrams, at 26, is seriously miscast as the most popular and sought-after boy in school. He just isn't convincing as a heart throb. Camilla Mendes who also looks much, much older than your average teen executes her role well, while Sophie Turner looks so much older than her true age that it was uncomfortable to watch her. Sarah Michelle Gellar is one of the few bright spots in this. The rest of the cast is adequate but forgettable.

The comparisons this film hopes to make to films of the 80's, 90's, etc is painfully obvious and it painfully misses the mark.

Teens can be written as complicated, intelligent, mature-ish human beings. Why have they so often stopped being written that way?",4,-1,-1

It's like cruel intentions had a baby.with Strangers On A Train which then got brain damage from smoking too much crystal meth and now is in a wheelchair that is driven by blowing a straw. There is more depth in a bag of Cheetos than this hot bag of trash. The main girl with dark hair is very good looking, so that is nice, but.that is not enough to make a good movie. Another thing I don't like is how the dialogue is clearly written by middle aged hipsters with lots of references to 80s movies and stuff than teenagers now would clearly have no idea about, that is just self indulgent and unrealistic.

People might say I sm getting old and out of touch, but I really do think music, tv shows, and movies are all getting noticeably worse, I'm not exactly sure why, but it is what it is. This whole movie is like the writers picked a few films they want to rip off, made a playlist of their favourite songs, got a bunch of hot upcoming actors, and wrote the actual script in one coked up evening, there is not one original idea in this mess.

There were scenes that weren't meant to be funny that I laughed at a lot. Also, not a groundbreaking concept discovery but different generations really aren't so different, just use different language and gadgets because about an hour in it stops being a Gen z movie and just a gaudy high school movie. At some point thought the movie was over but there was still a chunk of time left and it only got better with the twists, the last one not so much but it needed a happy ended. This may not start out as a movie for everyone but it is way better than I expected.

I just need to understand why this happens, i mean there are new talents discovered everyday, why do film producers feel the need to cast much older actors for roles that are clearly not right for them. I didn't really enjoy that film, didn't identify or sympathize with anyone in it. It had way too many twists and unrealistic things, so it stopped making sense to me. But i did like the soundtrack.

Also There was a lot of the pronouns stuff and I mean, I know that's a thing, but where I live it's not all about that life. I feel this movie won't age well, it will never be a classic. It's only playing the ""check the boxes"" game. Anyone who was satisfied by that is not a movie fan. Just a fan of being catered to. And I didn't think that was what movies were about. I want to be entertained. TELL ME A STORY! A good one! Leave the rest out. I couldn't even finish it. And I finished a handful of 2 star movies. I may have been disappointed but I finished.

Then, just when things look straightforward, ""Do Revenge"" adds a twist midway through that I honestly wasn't expecting.

Added tension. Added scenes where the two leads really had to sell.

Which they did.

AND THEN the movie twisted back to make for a satisfying, comfortable ending that we might have expected from the first.

All in all, a fresh, fun ride.

Character motivations are non existent, nothing is real, the acting is absolutely atrocious - I know I said that already but it bears repeating. Do yourself a favor and skip this utter bore-fest.

766,766,Do Revenge,6.3,Comedy,27-Sep-22,"A solid, violence-free teen revenge movie","This film is set in Rosehill Country Day High School, in Miami. Drea is a popular pupil who is attending on a scholarship and expects to proceed smoothly to Yale when school is over. As her senior year begins everything starts to go wrong. She allows her boyfriend, popular student Max, to film them having sex and somewhat inevitably the video leaks. She blames him and punches him... she is punished while everybody rallies round 'Poor Max'. One day, after Drea's car fails to start, she gets a lift from new girl Eleanor. They get talking and Eleanor reveals that she too has somebody who wronged her at the school. It isn't long before the two of them are plotting revenge; to enable them to get close to their targets they swap victims and set about exposing them. Of course not everything goes to plan and there are surprising secrets to be revealed before the story is fully played out.

I didn't expect too much of this but ended up pleasantly surprised. It may lack the delightfully mean-spirited viciousness of 'Heathers' but it still proved to be a good story of revenge. The fact that they were plotting to destroy reputations rather than end lives made the story all the more believable even if characters felt a little exaggerated. The film has the feel of classic '80s and '90s high school dramas with the necessary updates for modern life. The central characters, especially Drea and Eleanor are solid and one can sympathise with their desire to get revenge. As the story progresses we get some really good twists that left me wondering just how everything would work out. The cast is solid, even if they are many years past school age. Standing out are Camila Mendes and Maya Hawke as Drea and Eleanor respectively. It was also rather fun to see Sarah Michelle Gellar as the school's head. Several reviewers have commented on the films wokeness; I don't know if it was intentional but I felt it was a satire on some of the people espousing those views.

""Do Revenge"" uses the self-contained pressure cooker environment of a school to essentially examine the utterly unhinged insanity of blatant normality (in particular, when adolescents are concentrated together during their formative years), lensing how our perspective in life is often shaped through childhood trauma, oppressive systems (like the patriarchy) & it equally portrays the unrestrained viciousness of common interactions we often had as kids with a startling honesty (leaving us with a sense of realisation ""we really were like that?""). The film shouldn't be anywhere near as amusing as it continually is (being this confrontational), yet despite its challenging nature, the themes & messages conveyed are delivered in such a playful & skillful way (meticulously crafting plot twist after the next with some of the most quotable lines of dialogue I've heard for a while & retaining a sense of hopefulness, despite the brazen cynicism), it succeeds in being a thoroughly enjoyable watch, nonetheless.

Sure, I had a crush on someone, but I don't really remember whom exactly. I still recall the movies though, that made a big impression on me back then. It was Dr. Strangelove by Kubrick and Cut-de-Sac by Polanski (amongst others).

Apparently today the only interest teenagers have, is what other people think of them.

Here everyone is jealous, petty, miserable, envious, self-centred, vain, unlikable all the time, but for some strange reason only the white male character turns out to be a bad one. Seriously, everyone is constantly talking about themselves, and since they are all boring to begin with, it makes for a really really tedious script.

There is no-one to root for and as all characters appear equally annoying, you don't care who takes revenge on whom, and frankly, from halfway on through this yawnfeast neither do the characters themselves.

Everything is shot in super clean tv commercial style, like people live in inside a tacky sales catalogue.

As a comedy, I don't think anyone laughed, but there were plenty of eye-rolls and cringes. The story was predictable, and even the twists weren't anything unexpected.

The script is ridiculously lazy and dumb, the acting probably the worst there is (from every single person in the cast), it was literally unbearable, I had to fast forward some scenes just to avoid the cringe!

I wasn't expecting much from her and I didn't get much, so the world is as it should be. That said, the acting in general wasn't great but it wasn't distracting and that's all I can hope for with these type of movies.

H. Lawrence this film is it's most recent adaptation. Set during WWI Lord Clifford Chatterly marries Connie Reid. He almost immediately goes back to the front where he is injured in the war. When he comes home he is unable to father children or use his legs. He moves his wife to his family's country estate, taking her out of the bustling London that she loves. Isolated and alone, Lady Chatterly becomes more of a caretaker than lover to her husband. In this version her husband discusses with her the idea that she could discreetly choose a lover to impregnate her so that they could have an heir, sine he can not father one...it only they know that. He set boundaries, that he trusted her judgment, but never wanted to know who the true father is. At first she is upset by his suggestion, but starts taking long walks by herself where she eventually meets the estate's gamekeeper and former soldier himself Oliver Mellors. Eventually Oliver and Connie start a torrid affair that does end up with her being pregnant.

The novel touches on several themes involving the class system existing in England, infidelity, and the conditions of laborers like miners. The film also touches on these theme but only in the broadest of strokes.

The setting for the film is beautifully filmed and the costumes are wonderful and period appropriate. I really appreciated that they had both male and female full frontal nudity. The film r ally makes a pitch for this story being about a great love story and a woman willing to give up everything for this great love...only in the film I was watching I never saw that love built or nurtured. I would argue that there was a woman desperate to be touched physically and that there was lust...but I failed to see any love. I am afraid having good physical timing so you can satisfy each other's desires simultaneously is not love.

There were some decent performances by the actors and in particular by the actress who played my favorite character in this film, Mrs. Bolton (Joely Richardson).

I am not sure how I would rank this in a list of adaptations of this book, but I do know it is not my favorite. It is a beautiful film that I can recommend to fans of classics and those who are fans of historical dramas. I don't think I would recommend this to a true romantic however...and if lust is your thing, I think you would be better off watching 365 DNI in my opinion.",5,0,0

All is work tends to illustrate that. Lady Chatterley's Lover is a prime example of that beyond the scandal around its publication.

Thus, I can't say if this film has anything in common with the book. As I watched the film unfold, I struggled for any ""recognition"" of scenes and situations, without success. But that said, I fail to understand the ""hate"" that some reviewers are giving this film. Perhaps it's NOT like the classic D. H. Lawrence book, but taken on its own, it has some real appeal. I can't recall if the book had such ""modern"" woman aspects, and the film is occasionally a bit tedious in its ""blame the Patriarchy"" for everything......but that's simply to be expected in film making today. With its copious nudity, it certainly meets today's ""Netflix"" standards of having women-centric stories, and enough female flesh to hold the men's interest. The quality of acting and photography are actually outstanding. (although the extreme use of the color purple in lighting and clothing became very jarring at times) So, regardless as to how it compares to the source book, this film is very enjoyable and entertaining, both for male and female viewers.

But if this Netflix adaptation is anything to go by, we have not progressed.

Clean, polite, and fightfully well spoken, this version is imbued with a romantic innocence that would be creditable if it were not for the fact that the whole spirit of Lawrence's writing and intent has been tossed aside in the process. And for the sake of what? A global audience with zero risk of any problems with sponsors or censors - because this adaptation comes oven-ready censored.

Gone is the earthiness. Gone is Lawrence's explicit dialogue. Gone is any sense of the sheer joy and worship of the body. Gone are both Lady Jane and John Thomas.

783,783,Lady Chatterley's Lover,6.6,Drama Romance,03-Dec-22,"Less Head, More Heart, Please","Sometimes a movie is more than the sum of its parts. Not this latest LCL. Here the parts stubbornly refuse to come together (pun intended).

In a culture ruled by intellect and divided by class, Lawrence advocated for connection and the body. But sex, for Lawrence, is not solely about climax; it is also a vehicle of self-discovery, a way to transcend class.

Unfortunately, the film demonstrates little of Lawrence's penetration. Instead, Lady Chatterley and her story languish under a frigid ideological lens.

Thus Corrin's Lady Chatterley can best be described as 'disembodied.' The director is more interested in her as an idea than a flesh-and-blood person. Her face registers, but what is missing is the experience of her awkward, boyish body. Honestly, if she manifested a new consciousness in the way she moved and held herself, I sure didn't notice it.

Similarly, she arouses no physical chemistry in a fine-looking O'Connell, who in turn does capture the accent, but not the ecstasy. Their nude scenes together, devitalized by the wan colors of the photography, are the reverse of joyously sensuous.

Speaking of which, has Venice ever been less sensuous?

In the end, the film makes the viewer an intellectual observer, not a partaker. The film's elements, though in ever such good taste, lack that lush, unashamed appeal to the senses that would have immersed us in Connie's and Mellor's awakening to what it is to be woman and man.

After Jacks most recent series Rogue heros I was really looking forward to it but had a feeling I would be disappointed! And disappointed I was! Firstly there is barely any character build. Emma Corrin was awful to pair with an actor on O'Conells level! Everything between them was rushed and I felt nothing between or for them. The sex scenes were awful and I had to look away sometimes because Corrin looked like she was in agony not ecstasy! None of the characters were likable or did I have any feeling for any of them.

Connie is given a light feminist makeover, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but in most respects the writing and the direction loses the muscularity and the rawness of the novel. The scene with Connie and Oliver frolicking naked in the rain is emblematic of this director's approach. It's cute and maybe a tad naughty, rather than erotically charged or daring or liberating. And poor Mellors, while beautifully played by Jack O'Connell, feels somewhat emasculated by both the script and the tepid direction. It's also telling that they chose a boyish, svelte, hairless, almost twinkish type like O'Connell, who doesn't exactly embody Mellors as written by Laurence. So it's fair to say this movie is more Connie's story than it is Mellor's. The actors are fine though - particularly Joely Richardson as Mrs Bolton.

Nothing enticing or smoldering about him. In fact, I found both leads utterly unappealing with and without clothes. Where was the famous gardener showering scene that originally stirs her loins in the first place? This movie is lacking in so many areas. It was all so generic and bland. If you want to see this story on film, then stick to the previous versions or just read the novel which is a thousand times better than any filmed adaptation. Even ""Young Lady Chatterley's Lover"" conveys more of the story than this dreck and the color palette of this film is just dreadful. Just like the film itself, it's dreary and dull.

The writing was pretty terrible. It seemed as though they wanted to have somebody be the ""bad guy"" but they just weren't sure about who to make it. Direction was poor. Too concerned with the surface appearances and ignoring the substance. The set and costuming were basically BBC average.

There have been quite a few versions of DH Lawrence's famous and controversial book so we might wonder, why another? Well, most have not managed to pick up properly on the books main themes, about the damaging effects of the 'Great War', the consequent changes in society at that time, and the stifling British class system and it's continuing divides, expressed especially through the passionate affair between Lady Chatterly and her game keeper. This film does a very good job at including those themes, though it also plays with the original plot too, which might be a negative for some. I though it made a better film without sacrificing too much.

Jack O'Connell and Emma Corrin make a great couple with a real chemistry and all credit to them for superb performances. The sex scenes really are erotically charged and powerful, and I didn't think they were overdone. As we know, sex, liberation, release and openness are what Lawrence intended thematically and essentially symbolically through the central relationship.

The scenery was beautiful, the costumes were fabulous and not of a style that have I seen before in any film of this period. The acting was all good but I think I would have cast a different Connie, I find Corrin slightly irritating.

I do struggle with Emma Corrin because I still see in her the mannerisms of Princess Diana as she portrayed her in The Crown. However, she's very good in this but I'm sorry I can't refer to her as they or them as the actress (actor?) seems to prefer.

793,793,Lady Chatterley's Lover,6.6,Drama Romance,22-Oct-22,"Does the world need yet another adaptation of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover""?","Most of us know the story, but for those who do not: in early Twentieth Century England, a posh bird trapped in a sexless marriage to a toff falls for the fertile charms of a bit of rough. The end.

Except... director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre's version of the story was - according to the programme for the 2022 London Film Festival, where I saw the production - supposed to build on the character of Constance Chatterley, making her more than the voracious sexpot she is sometimes portrayed as. But even the Sylvia Kristel version gave Lady C a social conscience, and portrayed her as capable of greater things had societal expectations not condemned her to life as merely her husband's hostess. The only difference in this version is Connie is a bit stroppier.

Also, whereas previous versions have delved into Clifford Chatterley's character in an at least partially sympathetic manner, there is none of that here: as portrayed by Matthew Duckett he is chipper enough, but also the stereotyped, one-dimensional English snob (""Why can't the working classes be grateful?"" etc). There is no sign of the anguish most men would feel on having their ability to walk - let along have sex! - taken from them. Again, previous versions have done it better.

And the sex scenes are not very good, either!

On the other hand, Joely Richardson's version of Mrs Bolton is an improvement on previous versions, being warm and supportive to both Connie and Clifford. This is the first non-glamorous role I have seen Richardson take on, and she is the best thing in the film.

I hope anyone considering future adaptations of Lawrence's novel follows the example of many Shakespeare adaptations by keeping the basic plot but changing other things: set it further in the past, or in the future; locate it in Asia or Africa with an appropriately-ethnic cast; make it gay or lesbian.

Corin is usually excellent but this just misses. This story is so familiar and has been done so many times that we know the characters well, and we root for them, but it's difficult to care for either Connie or Mellors in this, they are so very bland there's little between them but fresh air. There is nothing here suggesting that they yearn for each other. There are many adaptations of Lady Chatterley's Lover and I'd say most, if not all are are head and shoulders above this. Sadly.

Did Connie love Oliver. The dialog says she did, but the visuals on the screen didn't convey that. Did she lust after him, and him after her. The movie tries to make you think so, but the sexual encounters were subdued and, actually, boring. All in all, it seemed like the movie was afraid to really get into any subject too deeply, and just wanted to give you a brief glimpse of several possibly interesting things.

The story is pretty amazing and delicately tells the tale of a young woman early in marriage who's husband goes off to war, comes back in less-than-best condition, so suggests to his wife that she might start looking elsewhere (towards other men) to provide an heir.

God forbid those days when this was the norm, to be able to provide an heir... regardless of the circumstances and whoever you're sleeping with to make it so.

It's more abit physical desires than emotional connection as they feel like strangers who barely know one another. The dancing in the rain scene whilst naked just felt awkward and out of place for the characters.

In Jed Mercurio's version he managed to make you feel sympathy toward Clifford at times whereas with this Clifford there is nothing likeable about him. James Norton did a much better job.

Pinocchio is a conceptually HEAVY film that doesn't condescend on its younger audiences nor it's older ones: it respects all the age groups equally and without compromising the story and fairytale-qualities of the Pinocchio story at its core. It's like a hard-boiled folktale that knows when to be optimistic and when to be cautionary in equal measures; and that's the magic Guillermo Del Toro does so goddamn well in SPADES.

This is 2022's best animated feature film, and one of Netflix's best film offerings in years. And it was worth the wait on Del Toro's part too.

Gregory Mann gives an incredible lead performance, imbuing Pinocchio with a boundless warmth and naivety that thankfully never becomes annoying. Ewan McGregor makes for a terrific comic relief and is an absolute joy to hear whenever he's on screen.

David Bradley is so good as Geppetto, subtly bringing so much pain to his character that breaks your heart and makes his moments of happiness all the better to experience. Rounding out the cast is Christoph Waltz, on point as usual with another truly evil character.

Guillermo Del Toro's and Mark Gustafson's direction is absolutely phenomenal, everything from the movement of the characters, to their designs and the vibrant colour palette is gorgeous and endlessly watchable.

Have managed to craft a version of Pinocchio with more personality, heart, and soul than Disney could have dreamed of crafting.

It injects new life into the character by telling a story that is vastly different both narratively and thematically than any version we've seen on screen before.

This tale deals with the malleability of identity, unconditional love, the impressionable nature of children, and the close link between joy and sorrow. And it does so with dark wit, refreshingly complex three-dimensional characters, and stunningly haunting stop-motion animation.

However, I do think this could have benefited a bit from cutting down on the plethora of plot points and having Pinocchio and Geppetto spend more time together. This version lacks the tight focus and brisk pacing of the 1940 version.

But aside from this, I was thoroughly entranced by this dark fairy tale. It has a spine and a soul, and unlike it's titular protagonist, it's far from wooden.",8,1,1

Unfortunately, I don't like this film as much as others do. It's a good film to put on in the background but I found it incredibly hard to pay consistent attention to.

Where this film really stands out is in its animation, the stop motion is done very well and the movie has such a unique look to it. The visuals are very dark and fit the gritty tone of the story. There's also some nice colour palettes at times.

The film includes a lot of songs, and for the most part I found them fairly forgettable. The voices also sound way too auto-tuned which gets quite annoying. However, the score itself is pretty decent and there's some good sound design, especially at the end where it really adds a lot of emotion to the story.

The voice acting from everyone was impressive, but unfortunately I found a lot of the characters to be fairly unlikeable. Ewan McGregor is great as the cricket, and probably my favourite character. Also, Tilda Swinton is perfect and I can't imagine anyone else doing better in her roles. Pinocchio, for me, comes across as very annoying, so it's hard to route for him at times. Additionally, I wasn't keen on Geppetto.

The film starts off with a sad and gripping first act, but I slowly lost my interest as the film progressed.

804,804,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,28-Nov-22,A good film that might not be for everyone,"A new Guillermo Del Toro movie is always something worth getting excited about, and I think his take on Pinocchio is another winner. While it might not live up to his very best films, it's another strong addition to his filmography... though it's also worth mentioning that he co-directed this one. Mark Gustafson is the other director, and he's not going to get as much credit as Del Toro, being the lesser-known name. But I imagine you don't get credited as a co-director unless you do a good deal of the work, so he shouldn't go ignored.

It's easy to see why this take on the Pinocchio story was appealing to Del Toro. It's a fairly dark fairytale, it deals with child characters in a cruel world, it blends fantasy and real-world conflict (here, it's set in Italy I think either before or at the start of WW2), and it's also a story with big emotions, being heartfelt and also surprisingly sad in places. All these themes/directorial trademarks can be found in Del Toro's other films, which makes this one feel right at home among them (even if it's the first to be animated).

The animation looks unique and is great to look at throughout. Unlike other animated movies with unique looks, I didn't feel like this one took a while to get used to. It pulls you in right away, and I think the music helps a great deal, too. It's overall a nice-looking and nice-sounding movie, with pretty good voice-acting, too.

The fact that it deals with mature themes (surprising amounts of death and Fascism in this movie) and might look unsettling to some, while also having child-friendly comic relief and music numbers do make it feel a bit odd tonally. I appreciate the effort that went into making this a movie with elements that'll appeal to younger viewers, and elements that'll appeal to older viewers, but I'm not sure the variety of tones is always balanced expertly. If I had any criticism, it's that, but otherwise, this is a very good animated movie, and another triumph for Del Toro (and his co-director!).",8,1,1
805,805,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,03-Dec-22,"What a vision of grief, learning, and being a good person (made of wood)","In case you were wondering what was missing from an adaptation of Pinocchio: 1) more Fascist commentary (not to mention Tom Kenny voicing Mussollini); 2) Frankenstein allusions (or sorry did I say allusions I mean he's clearly so in love with ol' Frank that the imagery is just there in spades); 3) a showstopper Ewan McGregor musical number that hilariously keeps getting interrupted until the ending (you'll hear it at the Oscar's live I bet); 4) the word 'Burden' made existential and harrowing for a child of wood; and 5) and an even more gnarly designed sea beast. It also made me laugh and cry and lay back in awe in my theater - feel lucky if you get a chance to go see theatrical and don't pass it up if you can - at one of the great stop motion animations of my lifetime.

I'm sure there are little complaints or nitpicks I can have - ie as strong and believable and emotional an actor Gregory Mann is for the regular scenes, he's slightly one note as a singer for me. But they mostly pale in this giant work of a vision that is collaborative (Jim Henson productions Co produced and I'd love to know if any of this was puppeteers not just with the stop-motion 24fps), yet del Toro's voice and mind and vision is very potent and daring; that of creating a story of Disobedience in the face of the Big Paternal thing of a Fascistic leaders and so called fathers, and a fairy tale in an Iconoclastic approach (meaning as he said at a q&a it doesn't tell you to obey your parents so you'll be a good boy, it says you should be and think for yourself).

GDT's Pinocchio is a wonderful hot chocolate that deals with parental grief; why Gepetto creates Pinocchio is a prologue that makes this a film as much about him as the title character and what he has to learn. It's loaded with what we've come to love from Del Toro and his collaborators (Desplat especially), and I hope it reaches families all over the world. How young can you watch it? Uh... how young did you see the Disney one? Go a year younger!",10,1,1
806,806,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,12-Dec-22,An artistic triumph slightly lacking elsewhere,"Hot on the heels of the Disney released Tom Hanks starring misfire that has found little fanfare around the world after its release on Disney+, Netflix's high profile and ambitious take on Carlo Collodi's beloved children's tale courtesy of the overseeing of Guillermo del Toro and his co-director Mark Gustafson is an artistic triumph that successful re-imagines the tale of a wooden boy and his creator/father in a way that brings new life and freshness to a story that unquestionably wasn't in need of yet another cinematic adaptation.

Transporting the fantastical adventure of Pinocchio (hear voiced by Gregory Mann) from the setting of 1800's Italy to pre-World War 2 Italy under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, del Toro and Gustafson's tale is a lot more mature and adult-minded than we've seen most times previously in film versions of this tale but as is to be expected from anything with the Mexican artists touch, the film still manages to offer up whimsy, heart and laughter around all the more serious elements that are sure to affect adult viewers here even more than any little ones that give the film a go.

Currently the longest stop-motion feature film ever made, every frame of Pinocchio is a significant feat of artistry come to life and vision explored, with one left wondering how on earth the team behind this effort managed to pull off such exemplary feats of animation to birth this tale into existence and whether its colourful cities, mangy looking monkey sidekicks, rabbit filled underworlds or a belly of a giant sea beast there is no doubt every inch of this Netflix original is right up there with the best of 2022's feats of film-making, making this film as close to a shoe-in as possible for this years Best Animated Film Oscar.

While there is so much to enjoy in a visual and aesthetics point of view not everything else in del Toro and Gustafson's film works to the same high level with some of the films infrequent hit and mostly miss humour (a frequently explored joke of Ewan McGregor's mistreated Cricket grows wearisome), hammer over the head reminder that fascism is bad, Mann's slightly irritating voice work of Pinocchio and most tellingly a collection of songs that feel slightly underused and questionable in a sense that perhaps this film might have worked perfectly fine ditching the song and dance numbers all together, combine to stop Pinocchio from operating in other departments as highly and memorably as it does in a purely artistically viewed point of analysis.

Undoubtedly Pinocchio can be viewed as a success and head and shoulders above the other 2022 film of the same name but when it comes to what cinematic version of Collodi's tale still remains best, the 1940 Disney animation must still be regarded as the king.

Final Say -

An outstanding artistic achievement that fails to inspire the same level of magic and awe as its technical prowess elsewhere, Netflix's Pinocchio is a good film that could've been an all round masterpiece if other pieces had come together to reach the same levels of its artistry.

It's a kids film seen through the eyes of an adult, that's the only way I can explain it, mature themes are dealt with, done in a way that audiences young and old can appreciate.

It's funny, it's incredibly moving, and as you'd expect it's also a little dark at times. Finally a film that's number one on Netflix, that deserves to be.

I loved the way Geppetto is depicted, he really is a troubled man, even hitting the bottle hard, David Bradley does an awesome job, as do Ewan McGregor and Gregory Mann.

The visuals are terrific, it's a beautiful production, it's different to the norm, but it's so impressive, again I think it would appeal to viewers young and old.

Take my advice, save it for Christmas day, it's a magical experience, one deserving of the special day.

I was expecting to like it, I wasn't expecting to be enchanted by it, it's magical, 10/10.",10,1,1

While my brain is processing and nitpicking the logic, my eyes and heart enjoys this. After finishing the movie, other than shedding some tears, I don't really feel anything much but entertained. Half day in, the movie is now stuck in my mind. Took me awhile to process the meaning of life I took from this movie, and the beauty, the growth, the love, the treasuring the time we have together, precious time. It is now in a special place in my heart. Hands down the best Pinocchio movie I have the honour of watching, in my lifetime. Thank you.",9,1,1

Others have analyzed it in such detail. First of all, Gippeto is a tragic figure for most of the film, never coming to grips with the death of his son. He makes Pinocchio but drops into a drunken furor. The church turns out to be an adversary. The people who saw him as a veritable saint now turn their backs. We have the cricket living inside him which is an interesting twist but so appropriate. There are friendships, discoveries, and war to deal with. Also, the little wooden guy has immortality. But is that a gift when you outlive those whom you truly love? I thought this was a sensational film.",10,1,1
811,811,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,09-Dec-22,"Not For Younger Kids, But Better Than Disney's Remake Of Their Version","Guillmero del Toro's Pinocchio is a movie that was cancelled until Netflix helped him revive it. While the year already had a movie on the wooden puppet in the form of Disney's live-action remake (which I felt was nothing more than another in Disney's long line of soulless remakes meant to serve as nothing more than to milk money off nostalgia while changing stuff like making Monstro a sea monster instead of a whale and the clock scene that was done for nothing more than a cameo of Disney's other movies), and let's say the movie does a better job in its own way.

Taking a different direction, the film has Pinocchio made by Gepetto as a way to replace his late son, Carlo, who was killed in the Great War. However, he goes into various misadventures with a cricket named Sebastian, Pinocchio is put on various misadventures.

Yeah, this is a lot different than how Disney's version went, and it's for the best. However, it is not for younger kids, as given the time this adaption is set in, as well as the fact that one of the characters is Death (who is portrayed as the sister of the Wood Sprite, the one who gives Pinocchio life), it can result in scenes that can be too scary or intense for younger kids. However, it brings a new take on the classic tale, and the actors all do a good job, and the stop motion is great.",10,1,1
812,812,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,20-Nov-22,A great retelling (and not a remake!),"From the get go, this movie had everything going for it. Guillermo del Toro knows how to make a good film, and this was definitely no exception. Now I'm a fan of the 1954 Pinocchio, and I'll say right off the bat that this is not a remake! Don't be foolish and think that, because this is an adaptation of the book more than anything. This movie took some creative liberties, some really good creative liberties, in fact. The movie is set during World War II, in an Italy under Mussolini. War plays a huge role in this film, and I think Del Toro did a good job of taking the basic ideas from the original story, and expanding on them. For example, a certain island setting from the original story is not present in this film, but in its place is a genius substitute that serves practically the same kind of purpose in a way. Every character is interesting and the worlds are very dense with details. While having a dark tone, the movie also finds a way to be upbeat and charming at times. Also, the music is great, the musical songs are pleasing to the ear. Best of all, the visuals are stunning, the puppets capture emotion even though they're puppets. This movie beats Disney's remake by a long shot, and I hope it gets lots of credit for that. Watch this movie if you like the story of Pinocchio, but expect differences and a darker tone. Your kids will like it, and you will love it. 10/10 totally recommend.",10,1,1
813,813,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,24-Dec-22,Zing Went The Strings...,"So I must be one of the very few to have never seen the Disney original although it's impossible not to mentally refer to it or think of its famous accompanying songs while watching this remake by Guillermo Del Toro.

Del Toro takes a stop-motion approach to the animation and generally adopts a much darker colour palette for his telling of the well-known story. That also goes for the much-altered narrative with the story planted firmly in between-the-wars Italy and the rise of fascism under the dictator Mussolini although it seems to me, in doing all this, that the director is alienating his younger audience.

It didn't help either that this Pinocchio is so much of a pain-in-the-proverbial when he first comes to life, with an especially irritating voice plus it has to be said, Sebastian J Cricket, by Jiminy, really doesn't register much as a presence throughout the movie.

And then there are the songs which are flat, tuneless and distinctly unmemorable. Of course, they enhance and elevate the Disney feature, but here if anything, they slow down the action. I also found the caricature portrayal of Mussolini to be just too obvious and dull.

It had some nice ideas like Pinocchio's ""Groundhog Day""-type revivals every time he dies and the epilogue is sweetly executed to at least end the film on a nice note but I have to say, on the whole, I found this modern-day take on Pinocchio to be longer than a lying nose and distinctly wooden, into the bargain.",5,-1,0
814,814,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,11-Dec-22,Elegantly Carved & Crafted...,"Geppetto's carved and chiselled a new son, replacing Carlo who was tragically taken, made from fine Italian pine, dovetailed, screwed and fixed with twine, just imagine his surprise when he awakens; as a Wood Sprite's taken pity on this fellow, who's sorrow, grief and sadness make him bellow, taken all internal strife, the grain now imbued full of life, though he won't age, he might just season, but never grow (except for an inbuilt polygraph). A cricket helps, to make sharp edges round, untying knots that seek to limit and to bound, but there's danger in the town, someone else would like to own, it's not too long before Pinocchio's has gone; whisked away, by the unscrupulous Count Volpe, who's recognised a fortuitous, new pay day, a puppet without strings, will make his tills ka-ching and ring, with some swindling alongside a small betray.

A dark and tenebrous retelling of the tale of the wooden boy that introduces some additional tangents and places it during the turbulent times of war and conflict. Great animation, some great dialogue, only tarnished by the fact that it's a perpetually told story, and you know what familiarity invariably brings (if you're of a certain age).",7,1,1
815,815,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,01-Dec-22,Exquisitely crafted,"This dark version of the Pinocchio story is exquisitely crafted. Del Toro's vision of a fascist Italy is richly detailed and filled with powerful imagery. The story is deeply moving as Pinocchio, voiced by David Bradley, struggles to stay true to his father Gepetto's wishes while also trying to find his path in life.

The animation style is unique for a del Toro film, blending elements from his other works to create something entirely new. The colours and visuals are stunning, giving justice to the grim world of 1940s Italy.

The characters are distinct and memorable, each brought to life with the help of excellent vocal performances. While Gepetto and Pinocchio take centre stage, their relationship is the true star of the film. The relationship between this father and son is both heart-warming and heartbreaking as Pinocchio wrestles with his conscience and emotions.

The music also adds to the atmosphere, creating an additional layer of emotion that helps bring the story together.

GUILLERMO DEL TORO'S PINOCCHIO is a remarkable piece of art that captures the horrors of fascism and celebrates the bond between father and son. The animation, music, and storytelling are all top-notch, making this an unforgettable cinematic experience. Highly recommended! (NOTE: Parents, take care. This might not be the most suitable movie for young children.)",8,1,1
816,816,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,29-Jan-23,Terrible voice acting,"Starting with an obviously great part, the animation and all the puppetry is incredible - all done incredibly well, with attention to the minute details, beautifully crafted and drawn.

But as much as the visuals are incredibly fascinating, the voice acting is incredibly annoying - I'd like to say it's just for Pinocchio, but no - pretty much all characters are voiced half-heartedly, voiced don't match the pace or intensity of the scenes or the characters. But yes, the voice of Pinocchio is the most annoying and entirely out of place. And what's with the singing?! It was totally uncalled for to make it a musical - it doesn't match the mood, singing is mostly awful and just as out of place as the voice acting itself...

Alas, it's not a good film, which is a terrible pity considering how much effort was invested into making it, and how it could have been with a matching cast...",4,-1,-1

I could not have admired the spectacular stop-motion animation anymore than I did on my first viewing. Every scene looks like a work of art in its set design and detailed characters. The story is astonishingly more expansive here as well, including the story of Gepetto's original son, Carlo, much more focus on the carnies who capture Pinocchio, and a look into the afterlife. Del Toro also tells a cautionary tale against fascism in place of the notorious boys-turning-to-donkeys scene (the joke being the fascists are a**es). While I enjoyed all of these new elements to the story and the phenomenal animation, I was left underwhelmed by the music. I think this movie is thrilling for kids (especially those 10-14 years old) and I would re-watch this again.",6,1,0

Maybe not Crimson peak so much tho...but I normally love his movies. And you can feel his darkness in this but I think Pinocchio might be the most annoying character on screen ever. I wanted to throw him into a fire. The voice actor was bad for me. He sounded like a snotty kid screaming at his mum in Harrods. And the singing...wow.

820,820,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,10-Dec-22,"An Intimate, Fresh and Dark Retelling of a Well-Worn Story.","In 1940, Walt Disney released an animated film based on the Italian fable of a wooden boy who came to life, called Pinocchio this version, by many, was considered the definitive version of the. Henceforth, whenever people think of Pinocchio, you then inevitably think of Disney.

I, myself, have never been a fan of Disney's interpretation of the film, it always felt too childish and messy to me, as well as all the racial stereotypes, however, I found the basic story fascinating, with its moral dilemmas and vague veil of horror encompassing the narrative. So, imagine my anticipation when Netflix announce a new adaption of the Pinocchio story, done in possibly my favourite animation style (stop-motion) and by a masterful filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro, whose gothic sensibilities shone in 'Pan's Labyrinth'.

So, it's 2022, the film has released, and, it somehow managed to better than my expectations.

The story, largely follows what you'd expect, but with a couple notable changes: it is set in fascist Italy, it is more spiritual and it is more philosophical. There are a couple more changes, but I don't won't to spoil them here.

The film from the offset is darker and more mature than the Disney original, encompassing themes of war and death within the first ten minuets. It also uses its titular character as a 'puppet' to convey humanity's worst and best impulses, which albeit, the Disney original did too, but in a more 'after-school' way, chiselling down its moral core to a nub of simply 'don't lie' or 'don't get addicted to vices', whereas GDT's version poses more questions than moral lessons.

GDT's version also feels equally more realistic and more fantastical, blending the two seamlessly, and, despite, his change in medium, it still feels and particularly bleeds GDT's style, feeling pulpy and gothic, while retaining its PG family rating.

Del Toro and McHale's writing elevates the story to new heights, the character writing feels very reminiscent of McHale's previous, the masterpiece that is the TV mini-series 'Over the Garden Wall', as each character feels loving crafted to be fully three dimensional, Pinocchio himself feeling incredibly reminiscent of Greg from that very series. However, the scene stealing character is Sebastian J. Cricket, voiced by Ewan McGregor, who, is this version's Jimminy Cricket, fittingly, unlike his predecessor, Sebastian is, at the beginning at least, a somewhat misanthropic writer, focused on writing his memoirs, as opposed to the generally high-sported Jimminy. McGregor's performance here is great, giving a wry delivery to the jokes with an unexpired sense of vigour, delivering some of the film's funniest and saddest lines. David Bradley is another stand-out, bringing life to a sadder Gepetto.

The animation here is simply breathtaking, with puppets from The Jim Henson Company, Del Toro and Gustafson bring the world to life with their intricate and delicate stop-motion and well-placed CG, everything here is tightly framed with a blazing level of artistry and elegance, brought together by stunning cinematography, it feels like two auteurs at their peak. Crisp and efficient editing ties the whole thing up brilliantly too.

The score is provided by the legendary Alexandre Desplat, with a couple of songs too, the score is exquisite, but the songs are the only element that feel like they should have had more time in the oven, other than two, 'Ciao, Papa' and Sebastian's Ending Melody, the rest feel a tad pointless, not bad, but slightly unnecessary.

Overall, Del Toro's Pinocchio is a staggering cinematic achievement pushing boundaries in craftsmanship for both live action and animation, with an intelligent script that honours and diverts form its origins that explores every theme it sets out superbly, making it the definitive version of the fable for me, firmly pushing Disney's vision out of mind. Easily, one of the year's very best, animated or otherwise.",10,1,1
821,821,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,7.6,Animation Drama Family,23-Dec-22,PINOCCHIO - someone has to grow some balls of wood and say it: it's not that great! GDT is past his prime.,"4* out of 10*

After watching GDT's latest work ""Pinocchio"" I went online to see if people were as disappointed as I was. Surprisingly, I couldn't find a single professional review that didn't applaud the film as a wonderful masterpiece. If movie critics don't have the balls to say it, I will: GDT has lost his mojo. What started to show in the mediocre and over-hyped Shape of Water and became even more apparent in the over-long and lacklustre Nightmare Alley is obvious after Pinocchio: GDT is not a very talented storyteller - and subtlety is NOT his strong suit. None of the two mentioned earlier films caught me on an emotional level and Pinocchio also completely failed to do so. It felt a bit like it's main character: wooden and without a true heart.

The film might look brilliant on a technical level but even the optical surface lacks heart. I was surprised that supposedly this was all stop-motion, because it felt like CGI all the way. I don't know what it was exactly but the film simply looks too perfect. The characters and scenery never come across like puppets, everything feels animated. Even if they put in years of handy work, I am sure they glossed over all the frames digitally and enhanced the images.

The first twenty minutes of the film were great and showed GDT's potential. However, as soon as Pinocchio showed up, it all went down the drain. If the film's biggest weakness is its main character, you have a problem. I did not like the design and looks of Pinocchio, at all. He looks creepy. Plus, the dude is a completely obnoxious jack-ass who is super-annoying. His voice was particularly bothersome. How are we supposed to root for him? I knew it was over when he started to sing his first song and my ears started bleeding. That song made absolutely no sense. Pino knows perfect English and knows all the words, until he doesn't when the song need him to.

Why was this a musical anyway? Every single song was terrible and the lyrics were so bad. The music added nothing to the narrative but catapulted me right out of the film, as I had to resist the urge to fast forward whenever they started singing.

The film generally drags a lot and could and should have easily been cut about 30 minutes. It struggles to find its tone and therefore its audience. Is it aimed at children? Too dark and all over the place. At adults? Not really dark and emotional enough and too childish.

Another major flaw is the over-bloated, weak script. The story is messy and all over the place. GDT shoves so many narrative threads and sceneries into the film that it completely loses fo-cus and fails to tell a cohesive story. There is the church theme, the carnival, the war camp (?), the Mussolini thread, the fish monster part, the other-world-hell narrative - it's just too much. All these disjointed scenes sure try to bring across a message. And they do so VERY heavy-handed. As I said, subtlety is not GDT strong suit. For example, we all know that war is horrifying and fascism is evil. However, both these topics were handled way better in GDT's early (and ONLY) masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth. This time around, he just crams these things into the film without saying anything new about them. He just shows them and spells them out. The terror of Mussolini's fascist regime is never felt.

Unfortunately, everything is literally spelled out in this film. Be who you are, don't try to be someone else. Don't project your dead son into a puppet. Religion is dumb. War is terrible. Let go, don't lose yourself in grief. Immortality is worse than dying. Lying is bad but sometimes, when it gets you somewhere, it's fine (??).

One gets the impression that either, GDT doesn't truly care about his messages or he simply doesn't have the narrative capacity to convey them in a convincing manner. He kind of picks them up, looks at them, briefly shows them to us and then drops them to pick up the next shiny idea he finds on the ground. For the viewers, this is unsatisfying and left me feeling stale.

One cannot help but have the impression that GDT only truly cares about himself and showing off all he has accomplished while neglecting careful story-telling. This can best be seen by the fact, that he puts his name in front of the movie title. A thing, film-makers typically do once they are past their prime. GDT marvels in the glory of his own name and the technical flex of the animation. This hubris culminates in the casting of friggin Cate Blanchett - only to have her voice a darn monkey without a single word of dialogue.

The Scottish cricket voiced by McGregor is tasked with watching over Pinocchio and providing him moral guidance to become a good boy, which is set-up big time in the beginning. I have never seen a character fail more miserably at their quest. He does not once guide the guy or even speak to him much during the film, for that matter. In the end, he goes like ""Yeah, I did my best, that's all you can ask of me."" and is granted his one wish.

I did like Mr. Filch as Geppetto, though, he did a fantastic job! Swinton and Pearlman did al-right, too.

All in all, a pretty big disappointment.",4,-1,-1

It would grow into a large tree and a cricket named Sebastian starts living in it. Geppetto uses the tree to make a wooden puppet. The blue Wood Sprite gives it life and names it Pinocchio.

This Guillermo del Toro animated movie has made some changes to the story. The most obvious is the change of the time periods. It does lose a bit of its old world charms, but the relative modernity does give it a fresh angle. It may be a surprising idea, but Pinocchio needs more humanity. In this one, he looks very much an animated wooden puppet walking the Earth. When the Fascists show up, the movie feels awkward especially for a kiddie audience. It definitely has some darker del Toro touches. The ending is rather poignant and that feels very human.",7,1,1

This is a European production, not Hollywood. Everyone speaks their own language, and at one point one French character admonishes another to speak in English (in the presence of Mrs Harris). At some points, I wished for full closed-captioning rather than just subtitles, since sometimes Mrs Harris slipped into a difficult-to-understand accent. Also, there were background plot points that just flashed by, so I needed an explanation from a companion.

The storyline follows Ada Harris (Lesley Manville), a 1950s widowed housekeeper. After falling in love with a Dior dress, Mrs. Harris decides she must have one of them and takes off on a journey to Paris, where she discovers what she truly needs in life.

I love everything about how this film looks from the scenery, to the actors, the music, the script -- everything fits the storyline so perfectly. All the actors are fabulous; every prop is in the exact right place; there is just so much hard work put into this film and it really shows. One of the most outstanding contributions to the movie is from the writers. The script is so perfect. Mrs. Harris' story sticks out to me because, while all of the other characters are young and have years to figure out what's important to them, Mrs. Harris is already half way through her life, and still isn't truly happy. Alba Baptista who plays Natasha did an amazing job! I loved her performance so much! My favorite scene is the Dior fashion show. Everything about that scene is terrific; the dresses are beautiful, the actresses playing the models made me feel as if I was in the Dior showroom.

The message of Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris is to never give up. Mrs. Harris is determined to help the workers at Dior when she helps them strike. She is determined to buy the dress, and best of all, she never gives up.

I don't understand dresses, luxury dresses, fashion, these things do not interest me and I find them meaningless. Of course, Mrs. Harris' passion and motivation made no sense to me. With that money alone she could have a very good vacation. But she wanted the dress. Paris scenes were beautiful. The production design was perfect. It could have been nominated for Oscar awards in this category as well. Anyway. I think the movie is delusional, dreamful and far from reality. Of course, it is a movie based on the book. Things like this are rare in real life. But it was still a very sweet, hopeful and entertaining movie. Anthony Fabian has done a good job. All the acting was perfect. Lesley Manville was a star. I think Alba Baptista looks like Alicia Vikander.

Anyway, it was a sweet and good movie.",7,1,1
832,832,Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,7.1,Comedy Drama,02-Oct-22,Wholesome and beautiful.,"I don't understand the negative reviews, it's completely obvious the plot and style of this film are going to be a certain way, it'll flow, maybe a few twists but I genuinely am astounded what some people were expecting of a film that delivers exactly what it said it was.

I'm a 35 year old male and definitely not the target demo but I love it, it was feel good, amusing, wholesome film that only Britain can seem to do. It was sweet, charming and made you feel warm. It dealt with the class difference well and it was nice to see French people portrayed as nice for a change.

The chemistry was great, I loved everything except one thing, it felt like 15 minutes was cut from the film, when she leaves Paris to come home, I felt that was rushed, I'd have liked to see the goodbyes and how people had settled to the new regime. It was briefly covered later but I thought that segment felt really rushed when the rest of the film built at a slower pace.

It's never really a criticism to want more of a film though. The lead was awesome, so natural, believable and likeable, the casting was genuinely great! I didn't recognise many. Bits are laugh out loud but it's more of a film to warm your heart. So if you feel a bit low, this is a great watch.",10,1,1

Leslie Manville gives a note perfect lead performance, imbuing Mrs. Harris with so much warmth and successful humour that her struggles will break your heart and make her triumphs all the more satisfying. The supporting cast are all good at making their generic characters likeable and layered.

836,836,Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,7.1,Comedy Drama,11-Aug-22,So Bland and Neutered,"A film that's so determined to be unoffensive that it ends up being hopelessly bland and neutered even for the kind of movie it is.

I love Lesley Manville, but she's not enough to save this film from being ridiculously silly. I could ride out this film's vibe for awhile by telling myself to just relax into it and accept it for the kind of movie it was trying to be, but by the end it simply asks too much of its audience. Resolutions come so fast and furious in the film's last half hour that whole dramatic conflicts are created and then resolved in the same scene.

I was kind of hoping the point of this movie would be that Mrs. Harris decides her dream of wanting to wear a pretty dress is superficial and meaningless and to find the self-fulfillment she was looking for without it. But even that small departure from the formula would have been too bold for this movie.

Isabelle Huppert is in this to prove that she is contractually obligated to play an utterly off-putting character in literally every movie she appears in.

I would say my Mom would like this movie, but I think it might be a bit much even for her.

All of which might justify a higher score than I have awarded.

However, I reserve 8s for a film I would strongly recommend and this does not quite achieve that status. The story is too slight - the whole concept of an haute-couture dress being the dream of a bereaved working-class woman passes me by.

She has a dream to own haute couture and goes about making that dream happen. Along the way she meets, befriends and wins over a variety of characters.

It was disappointing to see the brevity given to Bill Murray and Russell Crowe's characters. But Zach Efron really did deliver.

This is probably one of the best post-Vietnam War movies to date, delving into the nitty gritty of how it totally destroyed countless lives of families and humans in general, not to mention the environmental damage.

Apocalypse Now brought the horror of the war to the screen as in the napalming of large areas, but it is good to see the depiction of the results of the war on the human bystanders.",8,1,1
852,852,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,27-Sep-22,Ignore the title.,"I saw this movie tonight, without having any idea what I was going to see as a part of a mystery movie screening. The movie even has a cold opening, no title no a tors nothing, so I was sitting through the whole thing until I found out what it's called. I had never heard that this movie existed, what it was about or seen a glimpse of a trailer. This is not a movie that can be marketed, and is likely going to bomb at the box office.

Which is a real pity, as this is one if the more effective anti war movies I have seen, and I'm familiar with most of the usual suspects in that genre. It's not going for the big heroic moments, it's showing what a bloody stupid idea war is, having the Vietnam war as a stand-in for all wars. That doesn't mean there are even more stupid ideas, like Chickie's beer run, and believe me when I say Zac Efron is entirely vanishing in that character. I expect him and Russel Crowe to see nominations next award season for their work here, but while Crowe is chewing every scene he is in, Efron gives a much more subtle performance. Showing more with his expressions than words, how he changes as the movie progresses.

In a time of big franchises, CGI extravaganzas and super heroes, it sounds odd to say this was a breath of fresh air. There is humor in the movie, but it doesn't subvert the message, I just hope more people are going to see this movie, and talk about this movie, making filmmakers aware that good storytelling is still in demand.",8,1,1

Mr. Zac Efron did a fine job telling James ""Chickie"" Donahue's true story of a man's strange plan to get up and do something by personally going to Vietnam to give all his boys from the block a beer.

It's starts out as a Frat boy style movie but the odd journey he goes though was special. Not sure how true the movie is, but I do know one man cannot carry that many cans of beer in a duffle bag, which I concentrated far too hard on.

It feels like Efron is trying to pull a Mark Walberg with this vehicle. Yes, Russel Crowe and Bill Murray are in this flick, but they are not pulling any weight here. Their parts could have been played by anyone and it was useless to have them in the film, cause it was all about Zac Efron finding the perfect part where he can use his boyish charm to still seem serious, but if he's hoping for an Oscar nod, I think Walberg, who could have killed this role 20 years ago, still has it down packed with Father Stu.

But either way, this movie was funny for those people who love movies featuring Northeasterners being as blue collar as possible while attempting to step out of their environment. I grew up close to Chickie's hood so I'm down.",7,1,1

I was also impressed by Ruby Serkis as Chickee's anti-war sister. When Chickee reaches Vietnam, there is plenty of commentary on the bravery of the soldiers fighting there along with the foolish decisions of politicians who sent them there. Also stars Bill Murray as the ""Colonel"" who runs Chickee's neighborhood bar. Recommended - 7/10.

Excellent cast overall and the leads were particularly stellar. Based on real events and people, within a short real life time-frame of 1967 America and the Tet offensive, lies this very good film. Partially a heavy dose of beers and bros from Philly juxtaposed with 1960's America's unflinching coursework on a culture of war escalation like we did in 1945, says Bill Murray as The Colonel.

859,859,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,23-Sep-22,beer man with a twist,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Can I buy you a drink?"" A simple phrase that can have a variety of meanings. In 1967, John ""Chickie"" Donohue did more than buy his buddies a drink. He hand-delivered beer after tracking them down at their military posts during the Vietnam War. Writer-director Peter Farrelly (an Oscar winner for GREEN BOOK, 2018) and co-writers Brian Hayes Currie (also an Oscar winner GREEN BOOK) and Pete Jones (HALL PASS, 2011) tell the story of Chickie's dubious trip to the front lines. His mission was to show the neighborhood boys that folks back home care, and the results proved eye-opening.

Zac Efron plays Chickie Donohue, a Merchant Marine from the Inwood neighborhood of New York City. Chickie is a hard-drinking slacker and kind of a joke to his family and friends. He doesn't really take life seriously and has no perceivable ambition. He is, however, a staunch defender of his country and the military personnel fighting a war that no one seems to be able to define. Especially 'the boys' from the neighborhood ... too many who have died for the cause. One typically ""full of hot air"" evening at the local tavern where ""The Colonel"" (Bill Murray) tends bars, hones patriotism, and honors those who (like him) have served in war, Chickie blurts out his intention to head to Vietnam and hand-deliver a beer to each of his buddies stationed there. His drinking cohorts support his idea, yet fully believe this is simply the next thing that Chickie will never follow through on.

To everyone's surprise, and despite pleas from his anti-war sister (played by Andy Serkis' daughter Ruby Ashbourne Serkis), Chickie loads up a duffel bag with dozens of cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon and heads out. That seems to be the extent of his plan because he basically has to charm and 'luck' his way through each progressive stop once he has secured a spot on a container ship headed that way. In the film, he secures a 72-hour leave, but in real life, as documented in the memoir written by John ""Chick"" Donohue and JT Molloy, his journey took almost 8 weeks.

The film plays a bit like a road trip, where Chickie interacts with multiple characters along the way. Some in the military mistake him for undercover CIA, which he uses to his advantage. At a Saigon bar, Chickie debates with war correspondents, including a photojournalist played by Oscar winner Russell Crowe. Chickie questions why they report ""only the bad stuff"", which is tough on morale back home, while the reporters counter with the defense of only telling the truth. A later part of Chickie's journey finds him in the middle of the Tet Offensive, running for his life with Crowe's character.

Director Farrelly, long celebrated as an iconic comedic filmmaker with his brother Peter, doesn't break any new ground here, but the remarkable true story keeps us watching. In fact, it feels a bit like a war movie from the 1950s ... mostly light, with a well-meaning, charming lead actor with limited range. Songs from the era are included, and the message seems to be that politicians don't always tell the truth (an obvious fact that we live with every day). Chickie's personal post-trip pledge of 'less drinking, more thinking' would be a good direction for many, and Farrelly includes a modern-day photo of Chickie and the boys from the neighborhood over the closing credits. A nice touch.

860,860,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,27-Sep-22,You have to wait it out,"I watched this as Monday Mystery Movie at my theatre and I think some people were expecting(hoping) for Amsterdam so when this started playing they sighed in disappointment. Bit harsh.

There's a lot of funny bits spread throughout the movie especially in the beginning. However, unless the Vietnam war means something to you, it's really not as moving in the beginning, it starts with several emotional scenes that assume you already care for the characters or the Vietnamese war itself(as an African, I didn't so much). Also, the acting starts out badly, especially from the sister, and after 'Gold' I thought Zac Efron was picking roles to show his acting abilities beyond just the ""pretty boy"" roles. For the first hour or so I was really just waiting for whenever the action starts, because it felt like a road trip through a war zone without really understanding the gravity of war as it's seen through Chickie's perspective.

Russell Crowe was by far the stand out in his role and dominated every scene he was in. It's a long movie so as it progresses you start to get more invested in it, not just the beer run but the war; but because it's so long it's almost too little too late, emphasis on almost.

The second half of the movie is much better if you wait it out, with huge intendment on politicians lying to keep their war in good public light. It's however not as moving and generic at the start. Being based on a true story is really what helps the message hold it's weight for the most part, and Efron is probably what's going to attract a lot of viewers.

It could've been better, still a decent movie in the end it just takes too long to find it's stride so it rewards those who wait. Third act of the movie is probably 8/10 for me, much much better towards the end so that might leave you with a more flattering impression than it deserves.",6,1,0

The direction, the scenes, the story - all put together really well. At times, it's so funny you burst out laughing at the simplicity of the main lead and how he lacks understanding of his surrounding. In other instances, it shows you the reality of war and how little we know of it. It's devastating for both sides. The aftermath of such a travesty. I recommend anyone to watch this.

Not horrors of war type moments, but those moments of realization that his assumptions were wrong. I just dont think Farrelly has the feel for telling that type of story.

The message is of course one we have seen over and over, and told much better in other films. You can mix humor and drama very well in a story, its done all the time. Farelly however seems to dull down the humor and reign in the drama so that neither have any particularly satisfying moments. I mean come on, this guy went to Vietnam during the war to pass out beer.

863,863,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,02-Oct-22,What a pleasant surprise,"I have had my fill of Vietnam War and World War II movies so I usually just skip over them. But I can't pass up Efron, Crowe and Murray in one without all the CGI and car chases and the bain of the blockbusters today.

Just a good script with great character acting and a wonderful portrayal of the government betrayal behind this was.

Since its based on the book of the same name written by the main character, Chickie, (Efron) the viewer sees where he goes from whole heartedly believing the government is doing the right thing to the truth of it all. While he is in Nam he sees the underbelly of the beast and all the lies that the public has been told.

I was really drawn into the characters and at times wondered if he was going to make it back. Efron does a great job as well as Murray being understated here as a departure from his usual up from and center roles. Crowe has a small part but makes his presence felt.

Chickie gets caught in the middle of the front lines, an attack on Saigon by our own government, sees the CIA throw a goon out of a helicopter and then they chase him because he saw it all and you can see how he is deflated. I found the second to last scene especially moving when he is on the military flight home with all the caskets draped with the American flag. Powerful.",8,1,1
864,864,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,10-Oct-22,Touched Me In The End,"The new Apple TV+ original film THE GREATEST BEER RUN EVER is being advertised as kind of a ""wacky buddy comedy"" with a bunch of New York slackers looking for beer in Viet Nam.

This advertisement is doing this film a great disservice for this movie is much, much more than that and deserves some attention - and eyeballs looking at it.

Starring Zach Efron (who has turned into an actor who is much, much more than Troy Bolton of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL fame) and directed by Peter Farrelly (one of the Farrelly brothers that brought you such comedies as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and KINGPIN), THE GREATEST BEER RUN EVER tells the tale of a New Yorker in the late 1960's who is big on talk and little on action. To shut those around him up, Chickie Donohue (Efron) decides to bring his buddies that are fighting in Viet Nam some beer from home. What starts out as a lark, evolves into something much more serious...and meaningful...for both Chickie and the audience.

Efron is quite good in the central role as Chickie and this film needs his inherent charisma in the center of this film as he is in every scene. Efron exudes goodness and sincerity even though, at times, he his speaking out of the sides of his mouth - or a place much further down his anatomy. And, as his character learns more and more about what is really going on in the war in Vietnam, his bravado and bluster fade and we get a glimpse of the real person underneath who is horrified by what he sees in this war.

Russell Crowe - who is finding a career renaissance in Supporting Roles - is strong (naturally) as a war photographer who befriends Chickie and takes him under his wing while the myriad of young, unknown actors who play Chickie's friends scattered across various theaters of action in Viet Nam are appropriately played as folks who think what Chickie is doing is hilarious to those who are horrified that Chickie would voluntarily enter this war zone.

The tone of the film shifts from fun and silly to deep and meaningful throughout it's 2 hour, 6 minute run-time, all under the watchful eye of Farrelly. He really has a handle on the deeper war-torn aspects of this film, while he (purposefully, I would imagine) shies away from his expected comedy and zaniness that could have been the first part of this movie. IMHO, Farrelly could have imparted some more zaniness at the start - to give the film a better kickstart (the beginning is a little slow) while also more starkly contrasting the beginning and end of the film - and the change in Chickie because of this experience.

I was drawn in - and touched - by the latter part of this BEER RUN and would strongly encourage everyone to check out this fine film.

865,865,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,09-Oct-22,Salvador meets The Hang Over. Not TO Be OVER LOOKED,"Although funny, this is not a comedy movie, this is a serious film. A well-crafted script in the style of Richard Linklater mixed with Oliver Stone themes. It has that authentic nostalgia in its production value similar to another film I watched recently called ""Licorice Pizza"".

But don't be fooled by the Title and the poster. This is a war movie like Under Fire or even Good Morning Vietnam. Where the protagonist secluded from the hardships of the world realises the true potential of humans to do the most horrendous things.

Everyone has a perspective towards Vietnam, and I really feel this film was able to explore the different belief's without taking sides. Surprisingly this is probably the most trueful representation of war I have ever seen in a movie as it shows both the reality and visceral experience.

I really enjoyed this movie. It helped to settle allot of the feeling I have towards how the world is currently operating. It helped me not to feel alone in my understanding of human nature. But most importantly it did not hide from the truth of war being nothing more than genocide.

This movie is a roller coaster ride but believe it or not it is a feel-good movie. It is simply about the people who do the best they can with whatever they find themselves doing, no matter the tribulation.

I think I'm of to watch Operation Dumbo Drop now.",8,1,1
866,866,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,01-Oct-22,Better than expected,"An interesting cautionary tale of war by late-mid boomers for, and with, millennials. Told through the eyes of people at home, it touches lightly on a few themes surrounding the role of media, propaganda and military deception and ineptitude. While my family were either too old or too young to participate in this war, it reminded me that I grew up catching glimpses of this war, much like Chickies neighbourhood, and never properly understood what was going on- and in that respect it seemed very on point. Zac Efron is great in this, and makes the story seem modern in an effortless way. Much better than I thought it would be.",8,1,1
867,867,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,11-Oct-22,Losing The Beer Goggles In Vietnam,"A beer run where one takes the beer instead of retrieving it is a bit different. A civilian making that run from NYC to Vietnam at the point of major escalation is beyond absurd. Yet it happened when Merchant Marine James ""Chickee"" O'Danahue decides to show the support of ""the neighborhood"" to the sons on the front lines. He used his status to hop a merchant ship landing in Saigon with a couple cases of brew intending to show love and support to his friends fighting a war he really miscalculated.

If fact wasn't often stranger than fiction this would just be a solid story about a somewhat delusional man. It's more though and the fact of being based on truth elevates everything. This story is told very topical with just the right emphasis on politics and humanity. It touches enough on the horror and the danger, but it evolves as the character Chickee realizes there's a big difference in what we believed we fighting for and what was actually going on. There's a subtle yet palpable poignancy hovering large.

I would imagine it requires a deft touch to bring this story to the screen while focusing on the absurd nature of it. The human factor blooms like a flower with one man's well-intentioned, but misguided insane idea to just show up with some beers for his pals. Peter Farrelly, best known for his comedic movies, does this story with skill and finesse. Comedy is used sparingly and appropriately. Well done. Also Zac Efron gives a great performance that will surprise. The limited use of Billy Murray and Russell Crowe, while economical, adds just the right turns. I think the movie truly lives up to the whisical title and much more. Don't miss it.",7,1,1
868,868,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,28-Oct-22,"Made me cry, impressive accuracy","I saw this film with a panel discussion with the real hero of the story, Chickie Donogue, and the director/writer Peter Farrelly. I thought the movie was beautiful and funny and moving, and I cried quite a bit. A fresh take on the war with an almost Alice in Wonderland feel, as this civilian finds himself in the middle of battle, in a world he could never have conceived, and his convictions are smashed by the truth of what was going on. The characters, all based on real people, seem ultra-authentic. Great acting, great directing. A great small-but-impactful performance by Bill Murray as the bar owner.

During the discussion they mentioned that almost everything filmed really did take place (with the exception of one dramatic scene, which was inserted to show the true scope of CIA war crimes) and the costuming and sets were made to exactly match Vietnam in 1967, the military uniforms, etc. Much care went into the production, and it shows.

The story is incredible, and this is a welcome addition to the roster of Vietnam war genre films, holding its own with the best of them.

869,869,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,27-Sep-22,One of the Best Movies of the Year,"I saw this at my local theatre as a $5 mystery movie. I was blown away. The movie is based on a true story about a man who wanted to show thanks for his soldier buddies in Vietnam. He wanted to show thanks by delivering beer to his friends over 10,000 miles away in a war zone. There were many funny scenes in the movie and many serious ones. The balance of political view points were well balanced and represented the time very well. After the movie I ran into a Vietnam veteran who saw the movie and was in tears because some of the scenes sent his mind back in time to when he was an ammo troop. My only criticism is there should be maybe a warning to combat veterans regarding the graphic and emotional nature of some of the scenes. There were triggering moments in the film for combat vets. Overall a great adventure film about a guy who was sick of the media hating on our country and a guy who was sick of all the loser anti-American protests of the time. He just wanted to show thanks by delivering beer to his buddies in war and risked his own life.",10,1,1

872,872,The Greatest Beer Run Ever,6.8,Adventure Comedy Drama,03-Oct-22,Mixed feelings but overall good and worth the watch,"Well if you're looking to watch this because you just think its a great or interesting story that needed to be told - you're probably barking up the wrong tree.

I felt as if this story was straight up dumb, mostly forgettable and overall just not that important that it's worth telling in an expensive movie.. Even if everything they portrayed is 100% accurate (can't even be bothered to check) it still is largely irrelevant and had no effect on history.. It's a bit of a 'who cares?' sort of story.

If you remove the actual storyline of the movie being about a 'beer run' and look at it more in a critical manner of the vietnam war then it becomes a more compelling movie.

One thing I think they did an excellent job of is portraying the similarity/parallels between what Americans did in Vietnam and what present day Russians are doing in Ukraine. The similarities were always there - this movie just did an excellent job of portraying it on a personal level.

Americans invaded a small little nation out of the fear that Russians would soon be on their doorstep.. Sound familiar in an opposite context? The geography may be vastly different but the context (and insanity) is identical. This 'phenomenon' was referred to as the 'domino effect'. People believed it wholeheartedly..

The parallels extended all the way down through into the brain washed citizens.. You may see Russians in those homemade public interviews and think 'how did they get so brainwashed?' while the vast majority of Americans don't recognize their country acted the same way for 50+ years.. This was really the environment in america back then.. For every long haired peace loving hippy that modern times loves to tell us about - there were multiple facist brainwashed Americans that would call you a traitor if you didn't follow the government line on the war.

It did seem like it was an intentional part of the scripting, the line that most convinced me was when the sister says something along the lines of 'the government won't even call it a war'. That was the only area that seemed a little obvious in its intention to relate the two. I can't say if that is a realistic talking point of the Vietnam war or not, it just felt like it was intentionally placed in order to relate the two for those that could not figure it out.

I'm sure a lot of americans will watch this and either dissagree with the notion that A) the war was wrong B) the war was not shunned by all, everyone was a hippy back then or C) just see it as a movie about a beer run - but hey not everyone can understand the same things..

The vast majority (nearly all) Americans talk about the Vietnam war in a proud and noble sort of way - particularly about the veterans. I would guess the majority have no clue they even lost the war.. I have never heard 'My dad was a Vietnam veteran' be stated in a negative way.. They'll never follow that up with 'and shot up a village of civilians' or 'committed war crimes with agent orange and napalm'. It's always a talking point of pride and expected admiration. It's brought up - still to this day - as a sign of patriotism to have fought in that war..

For those that still do not understand or do not believe - go watch Peter Davis's 'Hearts and Minds'. The most honest and realistic documentary made about the Vietnam war that I've ever seen. May give a good context behind why this movie was so well told.",7,1,1

My first good crying jag came during the scene where a mother hands Chickie a rosary to pass on to her son - I can't explain this as I'm completely the opposite of religious, but I started to cry like a baby.

During many, many scenes I would bawl my eyes out, for no special reason that I can explain.

875,875,Enola Holmes 2,6.7,Action Adventure Crime,24-Nov-22,Continues the character's story in the same light-hearted manner as the previous film,"""Enola Holmes 2"" is the sequel to the 2020 film ""Enola Holmes"" based on the book series ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries"" by Nancy Springer. Once again starring Millie Bobby Brown in the title role, it continues the character's story in the same light-hearted manner as the previous film.

Following the events of the first film, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) decides to set up her own detective agency, hoping to solve mysteries for the citizens of London. However, due to her young age and frequent comparisons to her famous brother Sherlock (Henry Cavill), Enola is unable to find any clients willing to take her seriously. As she contemplates shutting down her business permanently, Enola is visited by a young factory girl named Bessie (Serrana Su-Ling Bliss), who asks Enola to help find her missing sister. Enola immediately accepts the case and is taken by Bessie to her place of work; a matchstick factory experiencing an outbreak of typhus fever. While there, Enola soon discovers a shocking conspiracy that makes her realise she may not be able to solve this new case all by herself.

Back in 2020, I was quite surprised at how much I liked the Netflix film ""Enola Holmes"", a movie that focused around the adventures of the younger sister of the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Though the story wasn't anything extraordinary, what I thought made it so enjoyable was Millie Bobby Brown's endearing, energetic performance as the title character, a sharp contrast to her more downbeat portrayal of Eleven on ""Stranger Things"" that we were all used to up to that point. Considering the film is based on a series of books, it was inevitable that there would be at least one follow-up produced in the wake of its success, and now two years later we have ""Enola Holmes 2"", a sequel that contains most of the same winning ingredients as its predecessor.

Now a few years older, we get to see Enola not only trying to subvert society's expectations of 19th century women but also struggling to make a name for herself as a detective in her own right. The very fact that she is constantly being compared to her brother further adds to her frustration, as she starts to realise that this uphill battle is going to be even more difficult that she had initially anticipated. This added some necessary dramatic weight to the story because Enola learns that nepotism isn't always a guaranteed road to success. If anything, she is at a huge disadvantage having Sherlock Holmes as her brother, since others will instantly view her as the younger sister stuck in his shadow. I like the way the film treats this as a universal issue that any youngest siblings can relate to, especially those who wish to show that they are just as capable, perhaps even more so, than their older family members.

Like with the previous film, Harry Bradbeer continues with his fast-paced, Guy Ritchie-influenced directorial style that helped contribute greatly to what made the original so appealing in the first place. There were numerous parts where the film could have slowed down and become tedious but thankfully there isn't a single moment that drags since the action moves at such breakneck speed. Bradbeer also places better emphasis on the main plot this time, with fewer side stories that could potentially lose the interest of younger viewers. While there are some minor parts that didn't really go anywhere, they didn't distract too much from what was important to the overall story, and even then they were at least easier to understand this time around. Again, I must point out that haven't read any of the original ""Enola Holmes"" books so I'm not entirely sure how accurate this film is to the source material, but from what I can tell it makes for another entertaining adventure mystery film for teens to young adults.

In her second outing as the main character, Millie Bobby Brown is just so much fun to watch as the loveably peppy Enola Holmes. Every scene she is in, Brown always looks like she is having the time of her life playing this young detective. Whether she's intently investigating a missing person's case or putting up her dukes against any adversaries who dare to take her on, there's a lot to appreciate in the amount of panache Brown brings to the role. Additionally, it was pretty funny to see her occasionally break the fourth wall to address the audience on any comical situation she is about to experience, both good and bad. Brown is truly one of the most talented actresses of her generation, and both these two films and ""Stranger Things"" are clear proof of this.

It was also nice to see Henry Cavill play a more prominent role this time as the legendary Sherlock Holmes. In the previous film, he appeared to be more laid back than in other depictions of the character whereas here he seems to be taking things a lot more seriously than before. This time we actually get to see Sherlock do what he is best at, and that it is using his famous powers of deduction to help solve a mystery. Cavill holds his own alongside Brown but never so much that it feels like he is trying to upstage her. There is a believable brother-sister bond between the two of them, which made watching them work together a considerably more enjoyable experience.

Unfortunately, Sam Claflin is notably absent as Mycroft Holmes due to apparent scheduling conflicts. This is a huge shame because one of my favourite things about the original film was watching Sherlock and Mycroft's conflicting views on how they should be supporting their younger sister. Instead, Sherlock is all on his own without any explanation given as to why Mycroft suddenly isn't in the picture anymore. Sure, this did allow for more emotional scenes of Sherlock and Enola growing closer as siblings, but there should at least be some solid reasons provided as to how come Mycroft isn't here to offer his own opinions on what path Enola should be taking at this point in her life. No matter how hard I tried to blank him out, the film still felt like something was missing without Mycroft contributing something to the story. Hopefully Claflin will be able to reprise the role if a third film is ever green lit.

As a continuation of the original film, ""Enola Holmes 2"" succeeds in pretty much the same way, with its charming take on the title character by its lead star and good use of pacing to keep things moving along smoothly. There is definitely potential for this series to become a long-lasting film franchise, but that's only if the actors and filmmakers are able to maintain this streak for the length of time required for such a commitment. At the time of writing this, there is no confirmation of a third entry but considering how successful both of these films have been, I would be surprised if Netflix doesn't give the go ahead anytime soon. So long as the entire original cast return next time, especially Sam Claflin as Mycroft Holmes, then I am all for it.

I rate it 7/10.",7,1,1

It's good, for the most part I enjoyed it, as with the first, I wish I'd kept it for boxing day tea, it would have been the perfect family adventure. It's very, very similar to the first, if you enjoyed that, I'm sure you'll enjoy this, if you hated it, there's nothing dissimilar here, more of the same.

Good storyline, very imaginative and creative, very good production values too, it looked pretty great I thought.

A shame that Mycroft didn't appear, I enjoyed his character in the first film, it did allow Sherlock to get more focus, and that was great, but perhaps also some of the problem, when Cavill is on screen as Sherlock Holmes, he does overtake, it was him I wanted to see more of.

877,877,Enola Holmes 2,6.7,Action Adventure Crime,07-Nov-22,Netflix did it again...,"This sequel has more appeal in the stories that occur in the background, while its protagonist brags under the main spotlight about a superficial and repeated fable. Both the plots of Sherlock Holmes, like that of his mother, concern a more realistic and intriguing tone, with a real threat, above the pretensions of an insufferable teenager. Yes. My main problem with this film is its protagonist. Her acting is highly unconvincing. Her interactions with the audience as she breaks the fourth wall is one of the worst attempts at appearing likeable and charismatic I've seen this year.

The film is quite decent and entertaining, at times it's funny and charming, it has a good message and a strong commitment to social justice, which is much appreciated, but the main role is a great repellant. To a lesser extent, so were the poor visual effects and to the more critical eye, the film's montage also feels sloppy. Continuity errors between shots and a rhythm that doesn't hold up to the story it's telling.

Now, don't forget this is a Netflix production. Of course, there is an inexplicable but predictable gender and race change of one of the greatest characters in the Sherlock Holmes universe.

There's something afoot, and savvy watchers know that and still expect to be charmed in the process. Too often, ""Enola Holmes 2"" forgets how to do that. It's undeniably not bad at all, but there are lot of things that could use an improvement.

The story is mysterious, as befits a film with this character, some funny scenes, but that's about it. The acting is at a professional level and it's a pleasure to watch.

I thought this film was fun from start to finish. It starts well, with Enola being chased through the streets by the police; we then flashback to learn how she came to be in such a situation. Her adventures put her in peril several times but never in a way that makes the film unsuitable for anybody but very young viewers. There are a couple of violent scenes, including a girl dying after being stabbed, but even this isn't too disturbing. As well as a solid drama we get plenty of laughs, many produced by Enola's fourth wall breaking asides to the audience and her mother's occasional antics. The cast is great. Millie Bobby Brown is a delight and carries the film as Enola. She is able supported by Henry Cavill, as brother Sherlock; Helena Bonham Carter is a lot of fun as her mother; and David Thewlis is great as the villainous Grail. I know some viewers don't like the diversity of the cast but, even though I often complain about excess wokery, I had no problems here.

Millie's acting chops should now see her take on some more challenging roles (like Florence Pugh). But for now these types of roles are right up her alley. The film has a great pace to it, and develops the characters well, including the new ones. The set design and costumes again bring an old London to life.

The new case became a turning point to improve the development of Enola itself. The existence of Sherlock becomes a new force in this film. We are invited to see the world of Enola further, including the existence of Sherlock. Sherlock's existence also gives an idea of how he works. Coupled with Sherlock's enemy, Moriarty who is also present in this film. However, Moriarty in this film is a woman. One interesting thing about this film is that the ending is apparently unhappy and leads to the sad death of a romantic story. Not to forget also this film takes an adaptation of a famous story in feminism.",8,1,1

Sometimes the knowing glances at the camera are perfectly timed, and sometimes they are over the top. Sometimes the mystery's intriguing, and sometimes it is laughable. Sometimes the interplay crackles, and sometimes it feels cartoonish. This series is filled with all the highs and all the lows. There's no doubt that Brown and Cavill kill it, but everything else struggles to keep up. If you have a middle schooler, it is a great intro to classic mysteries...but if you want a truly classic mystery, the BBC's Sherlock is a much better option. (Also, if we're ranking the Holmes adaptations, it is far from the bottom. And far from the top, as well.) As for the endings? Yikes.",6,0,0

I think it was just as sharp, witty, clever, fun, sweet, and entertaining. Millie once again does an impeccable job as Enola. Henry also plays the role of Sherlock wonderfully.

I enjoyed the case very much, especially being based on true events. I loved the twist on Moriarty, I loved the continuing romance, and I really overall enjoy the styling of this franchise. The production is something that gives me great joy as a viewer.

I would love to see even more growth for Sherlock and Enola when/if they release another installment. These movies are some of my favorites of Netflix's.",9,1,1
887,887,Enola Holmes 2,6.7,Action Adventure Crime,23-Feb-23,As fun as the original,"This terrific sequel starts with 4th-wall-breaking Enola starting a detective agency of her own. Just when it seems hopeless, a client appears and the chase is on.

Millie Bobby Brown is once again glorious and hilarious as Enola, chatting to the camera as though it's her best friend as she hurtles through a series of adventures. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, most notably David Thewlis as a gloriously reptilian bad guy, oozing evil from every pore.

Most of the original cast is back (thankfully not the horribly retrofitted Mycroft), along with the social commentary that carefully eschews relevance to the modern age and creates a social-progress fantasy of a real worker's rights leader. The movie does a wonderful job of creating bustling corrupt 19th century London.

I don't know that I enjoyed Enola more than the first movie, but it's probably the better movie. The story and mystery are more focused and it feels less like it's targeting a teen girl audience.

After two terrific Enola Holmes movies I'm hoping for another, and another, and another. Highly recommended.",8,1,1

Dear me it genuinely seemed like it was never going to end, whilst not a bad film, it also kills alot of the good qualities the first one had. Ignoring the obvious and obnoxious woke elements of casting and scenarios overall the film is just a bit convoluted.

I can't work out if Milly is particularly likeable or even that good an actress, I felt in stranger things her acting deteriorated, here it was ok, one dimensional and kinda repetitive. The looks to screen were occasionally funny but over used and less impactful.

The story was long, so long! It was a decent plot but just took way too long to get there, the characters and acting were good enough, to just think they needed better direction and 30-40 minutes less. This type of film is a 90 min fun easy film to watch, not an over 2 hour slog to get through.

I have similar thoughts about 'Enola Holmes 2' as I do for 'Enola Holmes'. Millie Bobby Brown is a strong lead, the support cast are good but the plot still isn't the most entertaining to watch unfold onscreen. I'm not sure it needed to be told over 2hrs, either.

Still, I got the required amount of entertainment from it. I appreciate the message and the story it tells, as well as them (seeming to, to me anyway) toning down the fourth-wall breaking - which is a tad overdone in the 2020 flick.

894,894,Enola Holmes 2,6.7,Action Adventure Crime,15-Nov-22,Enola Holmes Is Back At It Again Lighting Matches Under London,"It's elementary, my dear, Streamers. You knew from the second that Enola Holmes ended that there would be a sequel coming. Our plucky heroine would be roaming the streets of London searching for more crimes to solve and people to find. In Enola Holmes 2, Enola is back to solve mysteries and trying to one-up her older and vastly more famous brother, Sherlock. As these sequels go, however, it can all become a lot more of the same. Here's whether Enola is able to ""out-Sherlock"" Sherlock.

Enola Holmes 2 has an easy formula to follow. For everyone who saw the first film, you were already introduced to Enola, so you don't have to get the who Holmes family backstory again. This movie can move right into what is happening with Enola since the last caper ended. Here, she's about to close her fledgling private detective agency, when a young girl enlists Enola to find her missing sister. Eagerly, Enola takes on the case of these young women who work in a match factory, and she uncovers the disturbing truths along the way. Sherlock has a bit of a hand deducing in this mystery. Hijinks ensue.

Here's the thing: if you liked Enola Holmes, there's no reason you won't like Enola Holmes 2. Millie Bobby Brown has the same charm and plucky energy as Enola as she did in the first film. Henry Cavill returns as Sherlock, and even though he gets to participate in the crime solving, the focus remains on Enola and her fumbling towards a resolution. The movie is light and interesting. The case has enough twists and turns to sustain the runtime, but it is fairly obvious where the mystery is going early on. I will say that there was a point where I was exhausted by all of the running around and chasing the red herrings. If the characters weren't interesting and charming, I would have easily lost interest.

The main thing to know is that these Enola Holmes movies are really for your pre-teen/tween-age audience. They are fine for adults, but really, older people will get bored. Your 11-year-old niece will love this. She'll swoon at the burgeoning romance between Enola and her love interest. Your nephew will swoon over Enola and other castmates and wish they were Sherlock. All while being confused by the most obvious twists, turns, and clues. It's honestly a win-win situation.

Enola Holmes 2 is a cute teen movie overflowing with young women can do it power. This movie doesn't feel like it has as much energy as the first but it's still a quality movie. There is still charm throughout even though the mystery is a bit lacking. Grab a bowl of popcorn and the tween-age family member for a fun afternoon with the Holmes family.",7,1,1

But if you're a Sherlock Holmes stan or are looking for a resemblance to Sir Arthur's books, you're at the wrong place and you're up for a lot of disappointment.

Well, I enjoyed the chase, the breaking of the fourth wall, an enthusiastic Enola and all of the other characters. There are elements of surprise throughout the film and it isn't as easily laid out as some of the IMDb reviews claim. Though I did like the previous one better, I look forward to watching the next one.",7,1,1

Most of the actors are great, both lead and supporting roles - Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill are having fun, evil David Thewlis is evil indeed, and Susan Wokoma/Helena Bonham Carter pair is solid.

It's a bit less fun towards the end though, and the main villain reveal is lacking - it somewhat makes sense plot-wise, but both complaints of the character and acting were out of place - just not on the scale of someone who supposedly played the main characters for the whole movie.

The story, like the first film, giving a nice prospective for real world events, and sums them up quite nicely. The acting in this film is great, and aspecialy Henry Cavil's, who stole the show every moment he was on screen.

He was in Guardians of the Galaxy and Rambo is a Bonafede hero, but Samaritan makes me feel like I wanted to see the Italian Stallion (not a bad superhero name at all) as Batman or Captain America, and I know what you're thinking but still, something like that, not necessarily that.

I give Stallone credit for being able to be a selfless actor at times. He knows he's old and he does not mind playing the role of an aging action hero, which he did here so perfectly.

I don't see it as a blockbuster that should have come out in theatres. The fact that the movie revolves around Samaritan's relationship with a 13-year-old boy felt like he was trying to outdo big Arnold's lackluster, Last Action Hero, and it's even more predictable than a Rocky movie without the deep character dive that makes that worth wild Still, it triggered the child in me that remembers when Stallone made movies that might as well made him a superhero and the adult that consumed so many superhero movies that I just want to see the man suit up, for real.",6,0,0
901,901,Samaritan,5.7,Action Drama Fantasy,02-Sep-22,Stallone gets to act his age and still be a credible tough guy.,"Didn't have high expectations, but this was a pretty good movie. The story, with Stallone as a retired super hero living anonymously in a dystopian near future, allows him to play his own age while still being a tough guy in a credible way. The idea works well for him and he is perfect for the part. The kid, who the story sort of revolves around, is also good, and I expect to see a lot more of Danish actor Asbaek (from Bergen and Game of Thrones) who is excellent as an almost sympathetic bad guy. Thankfully the director avoids the one thing I find so annoying about these kinds of movies - endless fight scenes.",7,1,1
902,902,Samaritan,5.7,Action Drama Fantasy,10-Sep-22,I don't get the hate,"Is this the best superhero movie ever made, hell no, is it the worst movie ever made, not by a long shot.

Stallone plays to his strengths here

no long bits of dialogue for him to chew over, check
some good action scenes, check
vulnerable young kid for him to save, check
-some dodgy CGI, check
twist in the end you didn't see coming, unless you are that person at work who sees every twist before they even start watching it, check


Joking aside, it's a good movie and you won't want the 2 hours back as wasted time, I'd be a happy man if Stallone kept churning out films like this till he enters the pearly gates, yes he's old, but would I want to pick a fight with him god no.

903,903,Samaritan,5.7,Action Drama Fantasy,17-Sep-22,I love the idea of Stallone as an aging superhero,"IN A NUTSHELL: A young boy learns that a superhero who was thought to have gone missing after an epic battle twenty years ago may, in fact, still be alive.

The movie was directed by Julius Avery, written by Bragi F. Schut, and stars Sylvester Stallone.

THINGS I LIKED: Who doesn't love Sylvester Stallone? I love the idea of him as an aging superhero. He does a great job and looks fantastic. What an epic career he's had.

Javon ""Wanna"" Walton stars as the young boy who pulls Samaritan out of ""retirement"". Don't let his innocent face fool you; in real life, he is a fierce, five-time Georgia State Boxing Champion and four-time USA Boxing South East Regional Champion. He's the youngest athlete to represent the brand Under Armour!

There is a sweet chemistry between Stallone and Walton.

The opening credits look and feel like a comic book, superhero movie. Well done.

I got a kick out of reading the boy's list of people he thought might be Samaritan. One of the notes he wrote said, ""Pizza delivery guy - ran really fast."" ha ha There's a tasty twist that adds surprising depth.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: ""Take back what is yours"" by stealing from others? That's what's wrong with society today. People think they're entitled to what others have worked very hard for with no thought of how their actions affect others. Of course, that's the mantra of the bad guys in this movie, but I'm seeing this attitude more and more in everyday life.

There are plenty of action sequences, although none of them are very memorable.

Some of the CGI isn't very good.

It's not entirely clear what Samaritan's or his brother's superpowers are.

Does anyone want an origin story?

904,904,Samaritan,5.7,Action Drama Fantasy,26-Aug-22,Stallone was good but the movie is a letdown,"Really have no clue to the thinking behind movies like this, it's like watching a really bad live action cartoon, the awful clunky editing gives the impression that it was a last minute decision not to make it a mini-series but a TV movie instead.

At 76 years old Stallone does as good a job as actors half his age, some of the physical stunts and fight scenes are surprisingly quite good but the entire movie was let down by childish writing and an overall silly story together with painfully amateurish acting from nearly all the supporting cast, the flip flop personality of characters within each scene made it a confusing watch.

On the whole it could have been good, had the story not been concocted by the person that wrote the lego ninjago animated series.

It honestly reminded me of movies I watched in the late 90s, and no that's not a compliment.

I give this a generous 5 stars for Stallone and a few really good stunts, the rest of the cast along with the story gets a big fat 0.",5,-1,0
905,905,Samaritan,5.7,Action Drama Fantasy,28-Aug-22,Solid enjoyable movie,"This was simply a fun movie.

It had enough story to move the plot along, enough characterisation that the primary and secondary characters had distinct personalities, which is nice, had enough of a twist to remain engaging but it was telegraphed enough you don't need to overthink it.

The plot felt like it had enough space to breathe without becoming slow or dull at any point, so the pacing was excellent.

Enough is said in dialogue that the characters felt like they had lived lives and didn't need to cram their life history down our throats like some movies have them tell each other stuff they all know already just for exposition.

The movie just showed it through natural dialogue and actions based on the circumstances, except by the kid but his character is a loudmouth who doesn't shut up so it kind of fit without feeling expositiony.

Sly Stallone was pretty good. I'd forgotten he can be pretty decent as an actor, as long as the role is in his range, which this is.

Frankly the kid was kind of irritating, but the kid actor playing him has played annoying jerk who should get punched both times I've seen him.

Hopefully he either grows up to be less annoying, if that's a personal trait translating into his roles, or he picks a role or two where he plays something someone who doesn't need a good slap just to avoid being typecast as ""Oh god not him again"" which he's at risk of becoming of it becomes a trend.

Overall it's one I'd have no problem watching again, which is much better than the forgettable, consumable movies we've become used to expecting these days. I'd say it's a solid 8, it's damn enjoyable.

It's kind of a shame for the movie makers, the cast and crew etc. Because it's one that seems like it would get good word of mouth and seemed to be aimed at cinema release, and dumping it on prime probably hurts the bonuses and residuals that probably would have applied, as I bet it gets a lot of traction and positive feeling and probably good reviews, just for being a genuinely good movie made to be enjoyed by the audience for a pleasant change.",8,1,1

My main issue was with the bad guy though, I had no idea what his plan was, or why he was motivated to do it.

I'd pretty much given up on him as soon as regular people on the street start clapping him and following him into some kind of cult, who wrote that nonsense.

Aside from Sly's amazing presence, even he couldn't save the cliched and underwhelming screenplay. Aside from one decent twist, the rest of the story was generic and predictable, and lacked that ""superhero intensity"" in its writing. There wasn't enough substance in the story to merit the 102 min runtime, and the slow pacing didn't help much either.

911,911,Samaritan,5.7,Action Drama Fantasy,29-Aug-22,I continue to beg: rated R please!!!!,"Samaritan starts off with a really cool stylized opening scene that got me excited. The first act is mildly entertaining. You can feel the streaming-level quality but it's still enjoyable in one-time viewing kind of way.

Then the second act starts to meander and lose steam. I start to notice the bad acting, the inconsistencies in logic, the idiotic character decisions, and some really stupid parts that made me roll my eyes. The third act doubles down on all of this.

I went from ""this is pretty decent"" to ""get this movie out of here."" It also didn't help that I found it fully predictable. Maybe I watch too many movies but nothing surprised me.

But the thing that annoyed me the most is the decision to make this PG-13. All of the action scenes are screaming for an unrestricted R-rating. I saw a similar thing with Netflix's The Gray Man. It's a much better movie but should have definitely been rated R.

The difference is, The Gray Man did a great job of hiding the restrictions on violence, strategically with camera angles and edits. Samaritan doesn't try to hide it at all. There are scenes of brutal violence with zero blood. A throat is slit... with ZERO blood. It makes the movie feel amateur.

We keep seeing examples like this, like Morbius, a vampire movie without blood. I don't know when they're going to learn that this is a terrible strategy. PG-13 supposedly sells more tickets, but a good rated R movie is going to be more successful than a bad PG-13 movie.

But... this is a streaming movie with, to my knowledge, no theatrical showings. Tickets aren't sold. So why in the world would you limit yourself? Same with The Gray Man (limited theatrical release). I'll never understand it. Stop being cowards and go all out. (1 viewing, 8/28/2022)",3,-1,-1

It was particularly bad because it took itself too seriously, there was absolutely no humor and I'm saying that as a fan of Stallone. He just couldn't do anything to save this movie.

Everything about this film reeked of inferiority. Bad direction, bad cinematography, bad edition, and a terrible script. How did this turkey get made? This film is so emblematic of Hollywood's cultural bankruptcy.

Stallone was good, as was the nemesis character. The kid was annoying, the Tom was annoying, the bad guys were baying annoying. There was no entertainment value here.

The scenes at the end were so ridiculous, so comic book, so stupid, and so adolescent.

There was just absolutely no redeeming value in this film, save your time, watch something worthwhile.",4,-1,-1
913,913,Samaritan,5.7,Action Drama Fantasy,28-Aug-22,A hero vanishes and reappears,"This movie had a good plot and Sylvester Stallone was good in the movie, I just think they could have used the idea more than what they did. There is a twist I will not spoil but it surprised me.

Sylvester Stallone had a satisfactory performance as this hero trying to be a normal person, and the kid played by Javon Walton had a good bond with Stallone's character throughout the movie.

When the action scenes happen, they look cool and can be nicely shot. There are some little funny scenes throughout the movie, also I the movie was a bit slow at times, but it did not bother me as much because I was focused on what was happening.

The main villain had a backstory connected to Stallone's character, but I wanted a more to it than just that. I will say, the backstory for both characters is interesting and got me behind them.

Samaritan (2022) was an entertaining movie I just wanted more to the main idea it focuses on. Some people might like it and others might not, but I liked it for what it was.",6,0,0

Well...i think this 600 character thing is a new requirement...and i was wondering why noone else had already written a review...maybe there's a kickback so that people won't trash the movie so that the producers can actually make a few bucks. I hope you're catching on that at THIS point i don't CARE if you print this or not...like YOU'RE doing ME a favor? I don't think so...hey! How do ya like them Mets?

The storyline is predictable of course, at least to a point, but that doesn't make it boring to watch, with some nice touches here and there and a few moral lessons thrown in for good measure.

Really recommend to check it out if you are one of this people who stopped watching Marvel's productions some time ago. Simple story, great acting, some really nice shots. Even one fight scene where is no cuts, just one longer shoot which I really like.

The movie was perfectly cast. Sam looks and acts like River Phoenix in Stand by Me. Cyrus looks and acts like Keifer Sutherland from Lost Boys.

The CGI missed a little but it's not a Disney/Marvel movie backed by an endless budget. The story was solid. It was a little predictable but the character is original. Zero wokeness in this film. It's truly a new comic thrust onto the big screen.

I doubt there will be a sequel because the movie made it's point and that's okay.

That's a somewhat interesting premise that could have been explored so much more instead of what ended up being presented on screen, which turned out to be the most basic, uninteresting, uninspired and lazily written version of it imaginable.

The whole lore behind the movie about Samaritan and Nemesis is some of the goofiest and silliest you would see for a movie that tries so hard to convince you of how seriously we should all be taking it. And even the names Samaritan and Nemesis... Like are they even trying at this point? There was one somewhat interesting plot twist in the third act but that in no way helps this movie which was already dead by the time it reaches its third act. And all in all, there isn't much positively to say about this movie. Even the acting was sub-par at best (Stallone) to straight up amateur hour (the kid, the villain, his girlfriend, his lackeys...) for the most of it. But if you were to force me to pick one thing refreshing about this movie, I'd maybe say the camerawork and coloring that presents a somewhat noticeably cold take on a struggling city. That, and maybe Sylvester Stallone, but only because I love Sylvester Stallone.

Overall, I appreciate what this movie could have been, but that's still not enough to save Samaritan from its own writing that makes the whole thing feel underwhelmingly silly.",4,-1,-1

Tragedy ensues after ""Rémi"" doesn't show up for a school trip and the repercussions hit the young ""Léo"" and ""Sophie"" (Émilie Dequenne) - the mother of his friend - especially hard. On one level this film is about cruelty. Not a deliberate, malevolent style of cruelty - but one of indifference, of ignorance - a bully's sort of cruelty. On another it is a story of love, loyalty - betrayal even. It is an highly emotional film with two excellent performances from the young boys conveying their respective responses to a bewildering array of suspicion and judgements being thrust their way by those who knew no better - but should have. It's about parenting, about openness and about how people deal with tragedy in their own, personal way - and it is very effective. It really does leave a lump in your throat afterwards.

926,926,Close,7.8,Drama,24-Nov-22,Are We All Murderers ?,"I cried too throughout this film, but above all I felt angry. Lukas Dhont is an exceptionally good director, and he trod delicately over very sensitive subject matter. Eden Dambrine as Leo the thirteen-year-old has received well deserved praise for his acting, but then so should Gustav de Waele as Remi the youth who depends upon Leo's love, and yes let us call it by its name. Friendship there is as in all true loving but loving it is and due to crass homophobic remarks at school disaster strikes, and things are never the same again. Who was really responsible for the disaster? I think all of us as we are all afraid of this kind of loving and more often than not persecute it. Are we all murderers of the heart that has so many ways of feeling, so many forms that we wish harm upon even unconsciously? There is a stare at us from Leo and I will not spoil it for viewers when it comes. It is harsh, bitter and accusing, and despite its despair defiant. He looks at us the audience and even I winced away. This is a great film, and maybe I have overused this word too often, but from the depths of me I believe it ranks as one of the finest films I have ever seen. I must also mention Remi's mother played to nuanced perfection by Emilie Dequenne. A lot of very fine films come out of Belgium, but this one cuts to the bone of our communal responsibility in seeing love for what it is, and to refuse macho standards as seen by the sport thrusts that intercut various tender scenes. Homophobia in sport is commonplace, and there again it is another murdering ground for the sensitive and different. This is my opinion of this masterpiece, and I hope I have not misinterpreted Lukas Dhont's intentions. To sum up I have not seen a film about the tender birth of loving so delicately portrayed and acted with such burning grief and joy.",10,1,1

I can tell without spoiling that at the end of this flick I heard a lot of crying at the venue. Why? Because most people do recognise thelselve in the storyline.

As someone who had a very close friend who rejected me simply for who I am when I was younger, this film brought that experience so much more into focus for me that I openly wept throughout most of the last half of its running time. As a result, I found myself having a hard time forgiving the character of Leo as the film progressed, but eventually I felt I had no choice.

The performances and the chemistry between the two leads who play the main characters are so real and natural that at times I forgot I was watching a scripted and directed film rather than a documentary. I found the same true-to-life characterizations in Lukas Dhont's earlier film ""Girl."" He's clearly a very gifted director, and I would love to watch this man direct actors to understand how he's able to pull such amazing performances from them.

The film is also beautifully photographed, much of it taking place in the French countryside.

""Close"" is reportedly going to be nominated for an Oscar here in the U. S., and I hope that helps it get the wide exposure to audiences it so richly deserves.

Probably should have waited until tomorrow to do a more measured review, but watch this film for the acting masterclass from Eden Dambrine (Leo). To say so much with expressive eyes without uttering a sound; excitement, beguile, love, sorrow, terrible loss - one can't look away. What a find, and congratulations to the casting director. As for the film, kudos to the director Lukas Dhont for such exquisite framing, sequencing, colours and sound. Special mention to the flower farm hard work scenes, and the scenes following the boys at speed, whether running on a beach or through the flower farm, or on their bikes - amazing tracking. The topic of unbearable loss creating misplaced guilt is dealt with a sensitive directorial hand, and the maturity shown by a thirteen year old to navigate such a role must not go unrecognised. Also need to mention Gustav De Waele as the best friend of Leo and Igor van Dessel, Leo's brother - both are brilliant in support, and I also loved the subtle role of Leo's mother, played by Léa Drucker.

The acting performances of everyone in the movie is top shelf, but the two lead actors are truly exceptional, especially the lead actor ""Eden Dambrine"".

It's been a long time since a film has had such a BIG and profoundly deep impact on myself. It touched a part of my heart I had completely forgotten about, from my own childhood.

931,931,Close,7.8,Drama,25-Sep-22,sooo Close to a perfect coming of age film,"Close is a masterfully crafted look at the changing adoration shared between two adolescent boys. It is a skillfully written and directed by Lukas Dhont, who breaks the films into a classic three part narrative. Each chapter progresses though summer, fall, winter and then spring again and each depicts a new phase of the boys friendship. These changes are told with great effect and provoke emotions in the viewer ranging from joyful satisfaction and warm comfort to betrayed anger and even grief.

Close is set in the seemingly bucolic Belgian country side. And the film-makers take full advantage of the beautiful but labor intensive flower farm our one lead is growing up surrounded by. It is here amidst the farm's blossoming glory we are introduced to the indelible adolescence friendship of Léo and Rémi. For the first third of the film the two are inseparable. Rémi who lives on the same road to town spends his days at the farm and Léo then stays over at Rémi's most nights. Both are not yet burdened with chores of the rural life. So they get to idle away the rest of their last summer before secondary school in play and hi-jinx. Clearly this is how the friendship has been for a long while. And in that moment both would swear nothing could ever divide them.

The inseparable boys share a closeness that they manifest in a tactile intimacy with each other. This tenderness is nurtured by both families and particular by Rémi's Mother, a maternity ward nurse, who also likes to cuddle warmly with the boys. As an audience we observe the tender support and devotion each offers one and other with natural questioning of their sexuality. We, at the Directors leading, begin to wonder if at least one of the boys feels more than just platonic love for the other. To be clear the film presents almost no spoken homophobia from its many secondary characters to this possibility. The film is clearly set in present day Belgium. So much so even the main sport depicted in the film is hockey. So when at the end of summer the two are still inseparable amongst their new classmates. The fellow students although immature respond mostly with curiosity or disinterest to this possibility. But as the film's setting shifts fully into the classrooms and court yard of a new larger secondary school, some adolescent bullying and unwanted attention increases. The boys begin to question if new personal boundaries are being laid out. Sadly this effects one boy more than the other but both must deal with the consequences.

As you might imagine for a film like this to succeed the two actors playing Léo and Rémi, need to be thoughtfully cast and very talented. And Eden Dambrine who plays the thoughtful Léo and Gustav De Waele who portrays the talented Rémi do so with skill beyond their years. Their performances are without truly fault. But some might find Léo's cold unemotional response to the third act hardships as disconnected from the warm Léo we've been introduced too. This can be explained by the circumstances. But when the suppressed emotions are final dealt with in a wonderfully written climatic scene, one almost feels the response is just a little off the mark. And this is only notable because you do spend most of the third act waiting for this moment.

Close is well deserving of the critical praise it is receiving at top European festivals. And like the film's plot which moves us from one season to the next it will be interesting to see if the film can find as much praise in an english theater market.

I do want to end on a small spoiler. This film does not end in a feel good moment but rather one that is as harsh and honest as the rest of the third act. It deals with real complex subject matter and young viewers should be prepared for truly sad story shifts.",9,1,1

936,936,Close,7.8,Drama,06-Jan-23,A coming-of-age film for the ages,"Lukas Dhont is the name of one of Europe's most promising filmmakers, a director whose aesthetic goes right back to European classicists filmmakers such as Erik Rohmer. In Dhont's second feature, entitled Close, almost every strand of narrative is told through more or less disjointed scenes and segments, and every emotion and character development is implicit, often undercommunicated. The story is about two young friends from the Belgian countryside, Léo and Rémi, whose tightknit bond reaches a zenith the summer before they start secondary school. With new classes forming and hormones flowing, their special relationship is tested by means of peer pressure, conventions, and Léo's need for redefining himself and widening his horizons. This forces their pure, undefined love towards a definition that none of them have the maturity to outline.

Dhont had already made a name for himself with Girl in 2018, and his follow-up is equally hard-hitting, albeit arguably less obviously so. In Close, nothing is told or tackled head-on, instead we the audience is left with the task of deciphering and defining every single development. This is a form of moviemaking that had seemingly gone out of fashion in the post-streaming era, but which Dhont revitalizes emphatically here. His camerawork and patience with his actors is such that you become one with the characters. When his camera lingers on young Eden Dambrine as Léo, you're invited to a fusion between viewer and character; you become this young man and live out his predicament. If there ever was pure filmmaking, this is it. Which is why you also accept the small droplets of emotional manipulation that inevitably infuse the final part of the film.

Dhont's work is visually and narratively remarkable. But his most impressive feat with Close is how he has extracted masterclass performances out of his two inexperienced lead actors. The first third of the picture has a timelessness to it which is reminiscent of the Nouvelle Vague. And after the film's turning point, Eden Dambrine's expressive but understated face carries the story almost in a Brandoesque manner. His Léo is one of the best child performances in decades, and certainly on this side of the millennium, making Close a coming-of-age film for the ages.",9,1,1

The acting is simply incredible. Especially if you realize the two kids had their first time appearances. Eden Dambrine gives one of the very best performances of the year and beats out many Hollywood heavy weight actors for this. He is so natural. His expressions so impressive. What he does with his eyes is simply mesmerizing. There is so much he does in his most silent moments. A lot of actors can learn from that.

Gustav De Waele is also fantastic. There is one particular scene that rips out your heart and turns it apart. Great job. But the entire cast is amazing and the film proves to be one of the best ensemble acting achievements of the year. From the adult part Emilie Dequenne is the best. Her performance grows scene by scene.

It would seem that America does not corner the market on rigid attitudes about how males should be allowed to show affection for one another. But this movie isn't a diatribe against an uptight culture. It's more personal than that. It's instead more of a character study and coming of age film, and focuses on the boy who shouldn't have to feel guilty about wanting to establish some independence but can't help but feel that he's to blame for the actions his friend takes. Eden Dambrine, who plays the main boy, gives an astonishing performance. A scene where he's getting a broken arm set and bursts into tears, not from the pain in his arm but rather the cumulative pain building inside of him, reduced me to tears myself. It's not an exaggeration to say that he should have been in awards contention for this film.

As I write this, ""Close"" is an Academy Award nominee for Best International Feature Film, an award it will almost certainly lose to ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" which is an excellent film in its own right.

942,942,Close,7.8,Drama,28-Jan-23,Platonic Love Done Right,"Beautiful and heartfelt film. Close is, perhaps, the first film that shows the platonic love story in a right way. This film is so pure that I love everything in this film especially the message that the director tried to show us how pure love is when they are young. Without all the norms and discrimination that society have created, love is just love. The acting of the two young actors are truly amazing as they make you feel deeply connected to the characters and make you fall in love with them. Also, I live how the film chooses to portray the story in a realistic way that it never really give any answers about the characters' sexual orientation, just pure love.",9,1,1

Being born a gay teenager and in an Arab country that persecutes homosexuals, this movie was hurtful to me and I cried nonstop because this is true and this is what many persecuted gays feel in society, especially the eastern society, where you are afraid to reveal your inclinations only. Or that you open your feelings or that one day society sees your true identity that there will be a percentage that you will be eliminated just because you are gay. I loved my classmate at school, I loved him very much, but I did not dare to reveal my love to him for fear of society and his reaction, but I knew that he had feelings for me, but I refused to confess my feelings to him. , and now I really regret not telling him because I miss him so much. It's been 4 years and I haven't seen him. I hope that one day homophobia will end in the Middle East and that everyone will be free and proudly reveal their sexual orientation.

This overwrought, overhyped drama (and I do mean drama) explores what happens when an arguably vague schism occurs in the extremely (and I do mean extremely) close friendship between two teenage boys who bring wholly new meaning to the term ""BFF."" I'm supposing the ambiguity of their intimate, though supposedly ""platonic"" relationship has been deliberately incorporated here to add another level of nuanced depth to the ostensibly thin narrative, but, considering how this overlong, needlessly stretched-out story unfolds, constant watch checking is not to be unexpected, no matter how serenely beautiful the cinematography is. It's indeed disappointing to me how many other fine international film candidates were overlooked in the process of showering this offering with undeserved praise.

945,945,Close,7.8,Drama,30-Nov-22,Istanbul Film Festival,"The 2022 film Lukas Dhont, winner of the Cannes Film Festival Grand Prize.

The genius director/screenwriter Lukas Dhont, born in 91, is once again writing a magnificent story with Angelo Tijssens, with whom he works again after his first feature film Girl.

After the 2016 film Hjartasteinn, a film that we miss like monks missing the rain in the desert, Close returned with praise from every festival it attended after the Istanbul Film Festival, one of the festivals it opened.

Of course, even the 'lion' share in these praises belongs to our director Lukas Dhont, as well as the Belgian young dancer/actor Eden Dambrine, whom we watched as 'Leo' in the movie and whom Lukas Dhont met during a train journey and persuaded to take part in the movie.

Eden Dambrine portrayed the 'bully' incidents, which he probably went through as a dancer, which he started at a young age and gained success with, in the movie with a magnificent feeling.

Gustav de Waele, another talented young actor, has managed to gain a permanent place in the memory of the audience even with his short stay in the movie.

The director of photography Frank van den Eeden, with whom the director worked on the movie Girl, caused the audience to watch the whole story as if they were watching the whole story from the inside, with the magnificent framing and the wise choice of 1:66:1 aspect radio, that in some scenes, people intervened and gave Leo and Remi 'alone and alone'. It means 'you are not wrong'.

The music of the movie belongs to Valentin Hadjadj, with whom Lukas Dhont worked together in the movie Girl... The music is one of the most important strengths of the movie and it impresses the audience.

Especially in the last 20 years, very few directors make their audience wonder 'how good will he be in his next film', and the young genius Lukas Dhont is one of the rare names who managed to ask this question.",9,1,1

The character drawing of the parents leaves much to be desired. I am so much more touched when I see the movies of the brothers Dardenne, the best directors of Belgium. For example 'Tori et Lokita', the latest movie of the brothers Dardenne, is so much better than 'Close'. No, not an Oscar winning movie for me... And the storytelling is not good enough for me.

An expressionistic narration that exemplifies the ever-increasing importance of children's mental health as well as the means of separating those very children from such unpleasant, befuddling circumstances; and that is not by pushing them away or ditching them in screaming quietness, but by showing them care and providing them with the attention and space they desperately require at those delicate moments!

I hope that parents of young children will take notice.",6,1,0
948,948,Close,7.8,Drama,20-Feb-23,Beautiful and heart-wrenching,"CLOSE is a beautiful, heart-wrenching coming-of-age drama of two boys and their friendship. Written by Lukas Dhont and Angelo Tijssens and directed by Lukas Dhont, Close follows the story of two boys, Léo and Rémi, who have been best friends since they were children and have developed an incredibly close bond.

However, when Léo and Rémi move to high school, things start to change between them. Léo finds himself struggling at school and facing bullying from other students due to their assumption that Léo and Rémi must be gay because of their close friendship. As their friendship begins to drift apart, both boys deal with difficult emotions - loneliness, guilt and confusion - as they try to figure out how to cope with their changing situation.

The film is a powerful exploration of teenagers' complex emotions and struggles as they transition into adulthood, and it does an excellent job of capturing the intensity and confusion that can come with this period in life. The performances from both actors - especially Léo - are outstanding and perfectly capture the raw emotion of adolescence. The cinematography also helps to create an intense atmosphere throughout the film, making it feel deeply intimate.

I was riveted by Close. It is a beautiful and heartbreaking story, one that I think will resonate with many viewers. The way it captures the struggles of teenage life - from bullying to loneliness - and the emotions that come with them is compelling. It also offers an insight into how friendships can change as people grow up, which I think many will relate to.

The film also does an excellent job of exploring issues such as friendship and sexuality in a sensitive yet honest way. Close is a stunningly beautiful film that offers an insightful exploration of teenage life and the struggles that come with it. It's a must-watch for anyone looking to understand what it means to grow up in today's world - particularly for boys navigating friendships with other boys and the social expectations surrounding male friendships. Don't miss this one.",10,1,1
949,949,Close,7.8,Drama,17-Jan-23,Absolutely hearth-wrenching.,"To grow up in an environment that teaches men to be strong, distant and cold is to grow up in a place where you'll never feel free, where you'll never be yourself. Close is a masterful thesis on toxic masculinity and the impact it has on the social, mental and physical lives of young men in development.

As I was growing, I started to realize the massive impact society's embedded toxic masculinity had on my life and on the way I interact with those around me. Close feels incredibly important and necessary and holding this impactful story are some truly extraordinary directing and acting jobs.

The distant eyes, the forced friendships and conversations about soccer players, the dissociation with your true-self and the grief. Close is all about the learning, growing, griefing and understanding and it surely takes its time for everything to sink in, but I'm glad it does.

Close, besides tackling one of the most necessary and urgent themes these days, through metaphors and symbolism creates character growth and emotional depth. As the flowers groom and flow with the wind Léo has never been happier, but then everything changes it's time to pick up the flowers and leave nothing but dirt on what once was a colorful field.

The flowers grow once again only for Léo to learn how to pick them up.",8,1,1

One would expect Disney with all of it's resources, both financially and creative talent to make this work. As a matter of fact I was extremely surprised and annoyed to see that from over 12000 ratings nearly 18% gave this movie the top rating. I was influenced by this as a 6.3 overall rating is pretty good by IMDB standards. If this movie was trying to convey a message it was totally lost on me. I think for children it might be entertaining enough, but Disney used to make productions that would appeal to the whole family.

This movie belongs at the bottom of the trash bin in what I would label as generic. All the actors were acting with a capital A! It's trying way too hard. The one playing the boyfriend, Froy something was so animatedly over acting it was painful.

But without the humour or the thrills. Or characters that we even care for. It's just bland and doesn't evoke any sense of nostalgia or fun.

I didn't want to hate it. I tried so hard to like it. I definitely didn't build it up too much in my head because that always viewers disappointed.

In the intervening years, this Halloween perennial has garnered new generations of cable-watching fans who love the campy goosiness of the whole thing (the most outrageous gag to me was the casting of siblings Garry and Penny Marshall as husband and wife). The internet-released sequel has campy, goosey moments too--the newly-resurrected Sanderson sisters (Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy) bursting into a reworded version of Elton John's ""The Bitch is Back""--but a 'correctness' has settled over the Disney enterprise that drains all the fun from the witchy antics (it's too calculated). The sisterly trio are brought back to life in present-day Salem (don't ask) and must use Winifred's beloved spell book to seek revenge on the descendent of the mayor who had them hanged. The characters and costumes are fun to see again, but what's missing is original director Kenny Ortega's rhythm; the teenagers and the talking cat from ""Hocus Pocus"" may have been annoying, but at least the picture skipped along so that for every dud joke we got a rebuttal that was fairly funny. New director Anne Fletcher isn't taking any chances: she's after the mass audience--wanting everyone to be in on every throwback joke--which makes the movie too damn nice. Her prologue with the sisters as Salem youngsters doesn't really work (and is forgotten by the finish), while the rest of the kid actors come straight from the tube. It's TV Land for TV watchers. Whereas the first film had a little drive (everyone was hoping for a box-office hit, after all), this follow-up is content to rest on its trendy streaming laurels. * from ****",2,0,-1

Shockingly, the CGI is not well done despite the massive advances in technology. Since the original film. Note, for instance, the first scene in the forest with the modern teen girls when someone remembers to ""turn on"" the moon behind them in the long shot. Did no one catch that in post-production?

The squeal however isn't good at all, the jokes are so bland they don't make me laugh and three teenagers girls are so boring and one dimensional and generic they don't really add anything and songs in this cut way too short to enjoy this is basically fan service.

The existing characters like the witch sisters just so boring now they more like filler than real threat was it worth waiting for all these years later?

961,961,Hocus Pocus 2,6.0,Comedy Family Fantasy,30-Sep-22,"Despite its issues, fans of the original (like me) will see it as a satisfying celebration","I have always said that the first 'Hocus Pocus' is the best Halloween film for kids. It's a lot of fun, exciting, has a good amount of energy, has the right amount of horror to not put the kids off it and just makes you smile. So I was glad to see that the love for it gave birth to a long awaited sequel.

With the excitement comes the caution as sequels from 80's or 90's originals have a low success rate. But like with something like 'Top Gun: Maverick' I knew that in the right hands if they committed to the concept rather than try and make it contemporary to keep the interest of modern audiences, then this could be as fun as the original.

There is a promising start that will certainly engage the fans of the original and while the structure as a whole is very familiar, it still never felt like cash grab. There was enough to keep the story going while paying homage to its predecessor which is fine as that is the reason why this film finally exists.

The action isn't really as physical as before. But as a few of our stars are a bit seasoned now, some of the changes that they made to accommodate that never made the film drag for me.

The finale is certainly the film's high point as there is one moment that will get the fans emotional. It certainly caught me off guard. It left me very satisfied, and I think it will get a strong positive response with other loyal members of the fandom also.

Seeing the trio of Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker was just great. They have not lost their touch or chemistry and Midler in particular can still put on a great show. It never felt they were phoning it in. It felt like they wanted to give something back to the fans which was wholly satisfying. It was also great seeing Doug Jones return. Jones is someone that does not get enough credit from people outside of the industry. You probably don't realise how much work Jones has done and his signature physical acting was put to good use once again.

As for the new cast, they weren't as instantly likable as the ones from the original. But they did a perfectly functional job to help the story move along and were thankfully never annoying.

It was great seeing parts of the original locations used and bringing back John Debney for that memorable score to be put to use once again. Some parts did look a bit too polished, too much like a set and never felt as dirty or authentic as its predecessor. The pacing is solid but could have been a bit more rampant to give it some adrenaline. The slightly longer running time doesn't help.

Other minor negatives to speak of was that the stakes never felt that big or consequential. I'm not totally surprised at this as Disney don't try to make things too scary or risky these days.

But that being said, the fun factor and energy is still there and despite its flaws I had a blast watching this. As a fan, it was great to see the gang bang together. While some of the nods, call backs and gags didn't all work, they largely were well executed. For non-fans, I feel this will remain a pleasurable watch. It does a good job celebrating its legacy and never tarnishing it. The emotional and highly satisfying finale proved that they were basically saying thank you to the fans for celebrating the original for so long.

I really hope I'm not the minority as I try to avoid seeing beloved projects through tinted eyes. But I think as a film it's perfectly fine with some nice moments that anyone can be invested in. But this will clearly satisfy the fans.

I must mention that there is a post credits scene. It's hard to not give a hint without spoiling it. So that's all say about it. It's there for you to discover yourself.",7,1,1

However, it's almost exactly the same premise, just set in contemporary times and touches on contemporary discussions around female empowerment.

Some of the jokes are funny, and Bette Midler brings star power, but I can't help but think this sequel tarnishes the original. Hocus Pocus 2 didn't have the fun and thrills of the first film. It is very Disneyfied. More child friendly, and has no real antagonist.

Who is in charge at Disney?! They seriously need to clean house because someone is letting bad product slide through.

The film was shallow, soulless, and poorly acted from the supporting characters. The character development was so glossed over and superficial that you never even developed any feelings for anybody. It felt like a bad episode of goosebumps from the 90's.

Why wouldn't you try to get Kenny Ortega from the original or a team capable of putting something even slightly cinematic together? No one thought to maybe get a better script writer?! Are people scared to say anything in the workplace, because how the hell does this happen? Shame on Disney.

And as a side note, I can't even believe I'm saying this, because I usually roll my eyes at people that say this, but the forced diversity was so obvious and distracting in this that it takes you out of any sense of reality or immersion you feel while watching. I'm pretty sure Salem Massachusetts isn't this bizarre looking melting pot of every race where every other spoken line is said by some other ethnicity. Good god, I've hit a wall with this apparently, it makes me feel cringey and embarrassed for the actors while I'm watching and that's not supposed to be happening. I'm in the lgbt, I'm in part of the pandered to communities and it's not freaking working, it's ruining the product.

It was impressive to see the cast back together and the songs and soundtrack were excellent. Every song and dance routine was really good and I loved Doug Jones as Billy in this. Midler, Davis and Najimy were as entertaining as you hope. Disney really kicked the special effects up a notch and the depiction of Salem was entertaining and fun. There is a healthy dose of cheesy mixed in here but if you remember the age target for the content you can get over it.

It isn't without flaws but after nearly thirty years, I found the plot interesting and fun to watch. The characters are older but still gave nice performances and the new characters weren't awful.

Most sequels fail to live up to the original film and you know this before sitting down but that doesn't mean they aren't fun to watch. I personally liked seeing the characters brought back and can honestly say that I enjoyed the experience. In my opinion, had the 1993 original not been made, simply cutting the references to it would've made this a fine stand alone film.

They spent so much time trying to make this as woke as possible and forgot to have good acting, a storyline and decent CGI/effects. The song choices make no sense. Disney has no idea what they are doing anymore. The acting is atrocious. They didn't bring back max, Allison or Dani. They could have done an AMAZING storyline with all of them as grown ups and having the Sanderson sisters come back and this is what you create?! Who is running Disney?

From the editing the whole thing appears to be a series of lumbering, soul-sucking master shots made on the cheap al a Disney Channel girls/tween movie. It just made me sad.

The only redeeming moment was Bette Midler doing a musical number on a small stage (that sadly devolves into the same sequence from the first movie). Her voice, her ability to underscore the lyric with her performance - - just pure joy! Who can scream out ""BOOK"" like Midler?!

The whole thing amounts to setting up characters for a long, crushing series of Disney Channel seasonal originals...

If Disney Channel girl-centric shows and made for Disney Channel originals are your thing (aka direct to video). You'll have some fun.",1,-1,-1
971,971,Hocus Pocus 2,6.0,Comedy Family Fantasy,30-Sep-22,I'm surfing cowabunga,"Brilliant, not perfect but I enjoyed it immensely.

Compared to recent trash that Disney has been spewing out. This feels like they at least tried to go in a different direction.

Rather than just copy the first films plot. They added heaps of nostalgia with some of the same but with twists and turns throughout with a very touching ending which made me teary eyed.

Overall, the witches are back wanting revenge and of course like before they like a good sing song.

The music is sensational John Debney's score is a delightful a mix of new and old.

I can't wait to buy the soundtrack when it comes out.

No, this does not compare to the first movie.

However, I still enjoyed it. I thought the girl who play young Winifred did a very good job and was a great likeness to Bette Midler as Winifred.

Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker did a great job as usual. And yes, so did their younger counter parts.

I think the teenage girls did a good job as they had big shoes to fill!

Only thing I didn't like were the extras during the dance scene. It came across very strongly that they were just showing off.

Overall, an enjoyable movie to watch.

Sadly that is the best part of this movie the rest of the movie is full of cartoonish charechters, very low and bad jokes, charechters that no one cares about, very bad acting... even the effects feel low budget

it is obviosly made for little kids, but the original was also made for kids but then adults could also enjoy that one this one is simply too goofy.

974,974,Hocus Pocus 2,6.0,Comedy Family Fantasy,01-Oct-22,"Cute, Charming, and Easter Egg: This Spell Is Not As Strong of A Movie Overall Though","LIKES:

It's Cute: The first Hocus Pocus movie always had a cute and charming tone to it, and I can say that this movie has its own sense of charm. The movie is family friendly, making sure to bring those fun moments back to the 2020s. We have those relationships that make social media famous today, and you can dive big into the Disney charm the studio wishes to deliver. As such, the theatrics are there to please the modern day, including the representative part, that should make loads of people happy with this film.

The Actresses Still Got it: I'm not going to go over the new generation, but they have props. We know who most are coming for and it's the original Sanderson Sisters that cast the spell long ago.. Well, the girls still got the charm on many levels despite it being almost twenty years since the first installment. Of the three Parker is the one that's the ""rustiest"", not quite having the charm and promiscuity that the first Sarah had in the nineties. While this is a victim of the times, censorship, and the new age of Disney plot points. Still, she has the dopiness to it and is very quirky and idiotic that Sarah was always known to be in the first movie. Najimy has the next set of quirks that aren't quite fully fostered, again due to the new age, but Klutzy Mary is still as awkward, bumbling, and goofy that she made, only this time with modern day technology being her mode of transportation. It's Midler who is the champion of the three for me, capturing just about everything that made Winnifred, Winnie. She's boisterous, conceded, a bit of a bully, and unlikely to listen to anyone else, no matter the signs. She is the glue that holds this movie together for me, still capturing so much of the character that dazzled us in the nineties and continues to try to make the tradition meet the new boundaries set by Disney. It's not quite a mature or raw as the first one, but, she works well to be the character and evolve the head sister.

The Visual Effects Are Fun: The original had impressive magic to the moments back in the first Hocus Pocus that were great for the times. Fortunately, technology has been one of the things making consistent progress in the modern times to make the unreal, well... real. This second movie does have new things to trial out, and the Disney budget, even the Disney+ budget, is utilized well to make the spells, charms, and whatever synonym you want, to come to full life. It's not too over the top, still has some original charm, and really makes the whole ordeal that magical fun of Sanderson sinister times.

It's Sweet and Modern : I have to say I'm a sucker for sweetness to some extent, and the movie does hit that mark when it comes to its performance. Hocus Pocus 2 may not be the stylized adventure of the predecessor, but there are times at the end where the modern twist really does hit the feels. The last 20-30 minutes really do a great job of helping bring that awwwww moment, and I can't say that I did not appreciate the wholesome messages that modern day movies do so love to bring out. Had it not been so predictable and forced, it would have been one of my favorite moments, but I still have to give my respect to that finale in terms of feels.

The Easter Eggs: Clever? Not at all. Balanced? Again, not hitting that factor. But, for die-hard fans, the Easter eggs and homages paid to the first movie are loaded in this film for the uber fans to dine on. The second installment is all about making sure to pull old and new into the mix, and having those blasts to the pasts really helps bring smiles to die hard Hocus Pocus coven out there. You'll see it bridging so much, and sometimes the jokes are perfect, and I'm sure a second or third view will help reveal more I missed just like Disney desires to do all the time. I will also say, kudos to the comedy writing for using Easter eggs to poke fun at the modern times.

Book is Done Much Better: I can safely say, my favorite part of this movie is the infamous Book. Not for the cat call that Midler has made immortal, but for actually giving what was once just an impressive prop, more character this time. The movie's focus on story elements extends to the book that was anthropomorphized in the first tale, and made him my favorite character of this modern telling. Somehow, I found more emotional connection to the holder of spells, than just about anything else, and that finale, really did a great job, if odd, telling of emotion with it. Book's evolution in this film is quite honestly one of the better tale elements, and I think was a solid, if weird, angle to extend the tale on for this movie.

DISLIKES:

The Story is very quick and lackluster: The first movie may not be the Oscar Winning, groundbreaking story that other films have told before. However, in this case, the fun, complete, and quite planned out tale of the first movie is sort of loss to the popular, stuff it with emotions and fan base and give us a Spark's note tale. Hocus Pocus 2 is a lot of underdeveloped characters, teenage nonsense that is made famous in Zombies and Descendants. The emotional moments and real if character connections of the first one are sort of washed out and drowned by the overdramatized moments that do little for viewers like me. It's that dramatic for the flair again, rubbing it in your face that they need to be recognized and acknowledged that is just not as natural as the first film. Throw in background history moments, meaningful inclusion of characters, and hints of things to come, but never do and the tale is just lackluster compared to the bar of the first.

The Epic Twist is Bland: There is a twist to the movie, or perhaps two, that are supposed to be awesome and mind-blowing according to the fan base I've seen on social media. However, for this reviewer, it's a predictable, cliché, and unimpressive set of twists that is lost on fans like me. I feel it was supposed to be the same brand of empowering, dream big, moments that Disney wears like a bumper sticker. On one level, I appreciate it, and liked the direction they were going. However, the twists were not executed well, very in your face, and quite honestly cheesy like a PSA for some culture or another. As such, the twist just does nothing for me and needed more storytelling.

Loose Ends In This Movie Suggesting series coming: The modern age seems to be, create one movie and you need 18 more things to follow. This movie does not escape that trend and suggest there is more to come with the three witches story. While there are more obvious things suggesting this I won't go into, the movie has about three or four plot elements that are either introduced with no explanation, or not tied up at all, to suggest something else is coming. Based on sales, response, and the willingness of things, there could easily be a Hocus Pocus + in the future for uber fans to get excited to see, however, in terms of this movie, that annoying story telling takes away from the movie.

The Threat is Rather Absent: The first film had a bit of terror and stakes to the mix. The witches were bumbling fools, but they also were a threat, planning to suck the souls of kids to maintain their lives forever. This one though, that element is kind of there, but Disney's new age really diluted that moment and left us with more of a comedic villain, than an actual villain. The result? It's a movie with a missing piece that traditional fans like me like in their Halloween thrill. Even half of Halloween Town's villains were more of a threat than the direction this film took.

The VERDICT: Hocus Pocus 2 is a mixed bag of tricks for a writer like me who is a fan of the first one on so many levels. In this film, the movie is cute and keeps that family friendly atmosphere that it had from the nineties. Within the movie is plenty of homage to the original, with enough new flair to seed potential for modern day times having a place with the trio. With surprising development of a prop, great acting from the leading ladies, and some quirky magic to pump up the energy with, this movie really does try to play to a wider audience. However, in doing that, the other elements of the original are gone from this film, and the composure of a complete and well-done story went with it. This second installment has done bland twists, poor character usage, unfinished tales, and lackluster finessing to say it's the ""best movie of the year"" or ""oh my gosh so good!"". The modern day theatrics drive the bus for this film, and all the darker, edgier, and engaging aspects are gone for in your face shots of empowerment that fit on a t-shirt or Social Media post. The movie lacks so much of the emotional and entertaining soul it had, only getting to that point in the final act. I can't say this movie deserves a 1 or 2 like some do, though there are moments it does. However, this film is not quite the strong spell the first movie cast for me. My scores for this film are:

Grohl is pretty good, the rest of the band, not so much.

To be picky, in a movie that is not meant to be taken too seriously, it is a bit too long and that is not how you wire a car, Pat!!",7,1,1

I'm not sure how to segue from that, so I suppose I'll just start a new paragraph.

The greatest strength of 'Studio 666 (2022)' is arguably also its greatest weakness: the Foo Fighters and their wonderfully wonky acting. If there's any joy to be found here, it's purely because of the focal band and how much fun each member seems to be having. In fact, their energy is actually rather infectious and it makes for a rather sweet retrospective experience. In the moment, though, the movie isn't anywhere near as fun as it ought to be. It's goofy, gory and suitably self-aware, but it's also tonally inconsistent and far too long (it has about three different endings and ultimately settles on what's easily the worst one). It isn't particularly funny and it isn't particularly scary, either. It's a bit of a slog, to be honest. Pat Smear's almost permanent grin sort of encapsulates the picture's primary problem: it's always just one small step away from feeling fully credible. Every time it almost convinces you that it's a 'real' movie and you start to feel yourself getting lost in its B-movie pastiche, an unintentionally hokey or otherwise uncanny element will rear its head and set things right back to square one. Despite all this, it's never offensively bad. It's actually oddly endearing, even though it's undeniably subpar. It's never boring and its practical effects are surprisingly excellent. It has a couple of enjoyable moments, too. It's good enough for what it is, but not much more. 5/10.",5,0,0

The acting sometimes verges on cringe-makingly awful, but the kills, thrills and gore are plentiful and, overall, the film is fun, even if it does sometimes meander aimlessly. You can tell they had fun making this.

Ok kidding aside (though pun certainly intended), you have to have the right mind set to watch this movie. Liking (or even loving) the Foo Fighters doesn't hurt either. Have to admit that my knowledge of them is more or less Dave Grohl - what a fun and funny Dude he seems to be. Maybe not the ""character"" he's playing here - but in real life.

Apart from the mood, you also have to be aware that the Foo Fighters are not trained or learned actors. It never bothered me a bit to be honest - but I read and have heard a lot of comments about their ""inability"" to act. I personally give them kudos for what they achieved. Yes there are moments that are weird to say the least - but you can always see them in the disguise of comedy and making fun of themselves - which they clearly do.

There is enough gore and blood to keep you on the edge, but also a lot of comedy too. Yes the pacing may be weird at times, but I enjoyed even the silent moments. And everything sort of makes sense in the end. I did not watch trailers, but many things seem to be out in the open even before you watch the movie - still this is a fun ride and if you spoil it and get too technical (no pun intended) ... you just are making it harder for yourself.",8,1,1
979,979,Studio 666,5.7,Comedy Horror Music,26-Feb-22,The Foo Fighters vs the Forces of Darkness. It's likeable crazy comedy horror,"Once again we come to a movie where I'm uncertain if 2 or 15 stars is what I'd give it, so I'll settle on 7, this despite the fact that stars don't really matter with something like... this. I mean, what other film in the year of our lord two thousand twenty two will you see former Germs guitarist (and touring guitar for Nirvana as my wife pointed out) Pat Smear screaming his head off as CGI demons try to rip his head off? This is maybe the most baffling comedy-horror film I've seen in a theater since Tusk - and that isn't a put down, persay, it's just... what is this?! And why is Pat Smear sometimes not good at all and other times is very funny?

Studio 666 is written like it was by 14 year olds who just discovered heavy metal and/or the Evil Dead from their older brother's cabinet, while still coming from seasoned veterans (the director of Hatchet III no less), and who cares if like 3/4ths of the Foo Fighters aren't from the Stella Adler school? It hasn't stopped rock stars from appearing in stuff and for material like a story where a band has to record an album in a house that is a portal to hell they can meet the bare minimum.

You know as soon as you see the trailer if you'll go see it, in a theater, as I did with Scream 5 and had no idea it was coming and once I saw it my thought was ""HELLS YEAH... HUH... SURE! Wait is that Lionel Richie? Yes!"" It's bloody, dorky, chunky, stupid, awkward, puzzling, as funny as it sometimes is pretty unfunny (some of the timing of the sorta jokes fall flat), and if I were stoned I might put a monument to it in its honor.

I gotta get an Oral History of how this came to be some day soon. Other highlights: Will Forte's wig, John Capenter (who scored the opening with his son) appearing for a cameo and probably being paid with the whiskey he drank on set, and how hard it goes in act three. I haven't listened to Foo Fighters regularly since before I had my undergrad degree, and it made me semi curious.... nah, this movie is enough. One real downside: it's a little too long.",7,0,1
980,980,Studio 666,5.7,Comedy Horror Music,25-Feb-22,Worth it just to see Kerry King play Dave Grohl's drum tech.,"I knew I would like this movie from the start. Dave Grohl is a magical Rock geek and this movie extends that. I'm a little surprise Dave Grohl can't act cause I seen him in other movies but I am not shocked that the rest of the Foo Fighters looked stiff on camera, but the thing about the movie is even if your love of the Foo Fighters is just in passing, you'll love this movie cause the Foo Fighters are in it.

I mean watching Pat Smear just recite lines was so entertaining. No one else could have pulled that off, no other band could have pulled off being such god awful actors in a two hour film and hold my interest, but they were able to do that, and all with only little pieces of a new incremental they played over and over again as part of the plot.

The idea apparently was something the Foo Fighters just thought would be cool for the longest time and decided just to do it. As themselves, the Foo Fighters set out to make their 10th album different by recording in a mansion that is haunted. I personally have herd the myths of rock bands recording albums in haunted houses. The Red Hot Chilli Peppers are on record stating they felt a ghostly presence in the house they recorded Blood Sugar Sex Magik in (Drummer Chad Smith even moved out because of it).

Typical of Dave Grohl, who seems to love Rock and Roll lore, decides to poke fun of the whole thing with his own horror parody.

The piece is full of references to old horror movies, with clichés in every corner, but well executed, even Dave's possession is comparable to Jack Torrance's madness from The Shining (of course in totally different proportions). The violence is very explicit, which is totally normal in a horror and horror film. And the point that fails most in this film is the acting of the band members, but it is acceptable when you know that they are not actors, they are just musicians making a film that parodies reality.

The movie was filmed in secret during the pandemic, and it feels like that. It's as though the guys made this movie in their spare time, when their day jobs were over. It feels very much like an '80s b-horror flick, like something by David DeCoteau or Fred Olen Ray, and those guys' movies were generally shot on the run.

The problem with the movie is that it sticks too closely to established genre convention for it to be really fun, or really interesting. I would have preferred more in jokes or insight into the music industry. It could have been a horror-comedy ""This is Spinal Tap"". But you can always see the gears of the supernatural slasher plot turning.

The scene with the Lionel Richie cameo is a good example of what the movie could have been. It's off-the-wall and hilarious, and totally unexpected. I still liked the movie, but it's a pretty minor blip on the radio, whether you're a Foo Fighters fan (I'm not) or a slasher junkie (I am).",6,1,0

There is a sharp edge to the horror though: in the 1993 opening sequence heads are beaten to a pulp with a hammer, later a musician is shoved head first into a barbecue grill, these disturbing scenes are unleavened with humour. Otherwise it's stoner fun as bit part players and stars alike are electrocuted, chainsawed and meet other gruesome ends provoking laughter from the audiences (at least when I saw it).

996,996,Studio 666,5.7,Comedy Horror Music,17-Mar-22,Would have benefitted from a tighter edit,"Came into it expecting exactly what it was - a goofy B-movie with plenty of comical gore, horror tropes, and amusing jokes made at the expense of each band mate. I got all of these, however these moments were far too sporadically spaced throughout the movie, with idle chit-chatting that took the plot nowhere and scenes of the band rehearsing and chilling out, eating etc that were much too leisurely employed and dragged out for what felt like eternities at times.

It's a shame because there were enough quality moments in this to make it a great 70-80 minute movie, but space these out over the course of nearly 2 hours and it's a totally different prospect. The latter part of the film contained at least 3 places where the movie could have ended satisfactorily, only for another rather pointless event or 'twist' to take place to stretch it out another ten minutes.

Overall a slightly missed opportunity, as with tighter editing it could have been a cult classic.",5,0,0
997,997,Studio 666,5.7,Comedy Horror Music,26-Mar-22,RIP Taylor.,"I have to say, this film is worse than your average low budget deal because these guys are not actors. Dave seems to be the only person in the room making an effort. Sort of said seeing Taylor. If they knew what was going to happen to him they probably would not have released this. Notice how Taylor is the only person not to give a high-five, twice. I would not have noticed it or cared of I didn't know of his death. RIP Taylor, he is easily one of the top three drummers of all time.

Learn from Taylor and end your addiction today.",4,-1,-1
998,998,Studio 666,5.7,Comedy Horror Music,28-Feb-22,"Silly, gory, dumb rock'n'roll","'Studio 666' is a Foo Fighters pet project, poking fun at themselves, rockstar excess and horror all in a fun film. The plot is simple - Dave (singer/songwriter), Nate (bass), Chris (guitar), Pat (guitar), Taylor (drums) & Rami (keyboards) are wanting to do something different for their 10th album, so end up recording in a haunted house. The rest is mostly an 'Evil Dead' rip-off!

Most of the fun comes from watching the band, who are clearly not actors, have fun with the absurdness/silliness. There are some good cameos from actual actors - Samantha (Cummings) the neighbour, Jeremy (Garlin) the manager and Darren (Forte) the delivery guy. And while it's semi-funny, it's definitely very gory and I think the death-count got to 9. Jut not sure it needed to be 1 hour 45min - might've ben a good 30min TV episode.

If you're a Foo fan and appreciate the humour in their video clips, you should enjoy this. Lots of little inside jokes and they play against their nice-guy personas on purpose. Still, they're definitely not actors! Only one actual Foo Fighters song from 'Medicine At Midnight' is used, during the credits - the song they play during the film is actually pretty good, even though it's in ""L"" key.",5,0,0
